You must hurry.

You would do well to waste less time on{Newline}

{MClose}
I see even the noble Order of the{Newline}

{MClose}
A guard captain in these rain-sodden{Newline}

{Newline}
We are in employ of the Order, not of it.{Newline}
Our pay does not cover trite courtesies{Newline}
to the likes of you.
{MClose}
Govern your tongue!

Enough. Let us be on our way.

We will not be acting alone. The Order will be{Newline}
joined by, among others, His Excellency Duke{Newline}

I've made arrangements for him to enter{Newline}
the Akademy. *chuckle* You should have{Newline}

the marquis Elmdore de Limberry's household.
{MClose}
{Color 08}Delita{Newline}
{Color 00}A knight, you say?
{MClose}
Well, truth be told, I am a knight apprentice...{Newline}
as are you, if I'm not far mistaken.
{MClose}
A fellow knight-in-training, then.{Newline}
I am {Ramza} Beoulve, and this{Newline}
is Delita Heiral, my trusted friend.
{MClose}
Beoulve? You're not of the Beoulves{Newline}
of the Order of the Northern Sky,{Newline}
are you?{Newline}
What fantastic luck! A blessing in the{Newline}
midst of disaster!
{MClose}
What—?
{MClose}
The Order can help me rescue{Newline}
the marquis! It must!
{MClose}
The marquis is held captive?
{MClose}
They took him hostage, yes,{Newline}
but he still lives!{Newline}
{Newline}
We must act quickly if he is{Newline}
to remain so. Should he be{Newline}
killed, I will lose everything...
{MClose}
Calm yourself. Who's to say your{Newline}
marquis is to be killed, anyway?{Newline}
{Newline}
The Corpse Brigade would not take a{Newline}
man alive save there were value in{Newline}
keeping him so. Of that you can be sure.
{MClose}
There's little the three of us{Newline}
can do to help, in any case.{Newline}
{Newline}
If the marquis was taken hostage,{Newline}
Eagrose will be in an uproar. You{Newline}
can be sure of that, too.
{MClose}
Then before all else we will report in{Newline}
to Eagrose. Are we agreed?
{MClose}
Agreed. We'll start there.
{MClose}
You simply -must- help me!{Newline}
Please! I beg you!

No doubt word has already reached you,{Newline}

What have you a mind to do?
{MClose}
I have already asked Zalbaag to dispatch a{Newline}

These brigands must eventually come forth{Newline}

Please, my lord—grant me{Newline}
means to avenge my fallen{Newline}

Mayhap your ears fail you. I said that a{Newline}

{Newline}
You are not a man of Gallionne. Leave her{Newline}

B-but...my lord!

Do not assume to beg favors of me!{Newline}

Let me remind you, Argath, lest you{Newline}

{Color 08}Argath{Newline}
{Color 00}My own house was once respected as{Newline}
highly as House Beoulve, you know.
{MClose}
At least, until my grandfather was captured{Newline}
during the war.{Newline}
{Newline}
He turned traitor, thinking to buy his freedom{Newline}
with the lives of his friends.{Newline}
{Newline}
But his freedom scarce outlived his honor.{Newline}
He was not a dozen paces out their gate{Newline}
when the dagger found his back.{Newline}
Killed by some common squire, no more a{Newline}
knight than I.{Newline}
{Newline}
One of the men he betrayed later escaped{Newline}
and spread word of his misdeeds.{Newline}
{Newline}
My lord father would have none of it, of course.{Newline}
But he was the only one. Our bannermen{Newline}
deserted us, our reputation ruined.
{MClose}
I suppose I had best remember my place.{Newline}
Your lord brother has no reason to lend{Newline}
ear to pleas from the likes of me.
{MClose}
{Color 08}Tietra Heiral{Newline}
{Color 00}Delita!
{MClose}
{Color 08}Delita{Newline}
{Color 00}Tietra!
{MClose}
{Color 08}{Ramza}{Newline}
{Color 00}Alma! Zalbaag!
{MClose}
{Color 08}Alma Beoulve{Newline}
{Color 00}{Ramza}, you've come home!
{MClose}
It's been some time,{Newline}
hasn't it, Zalbaag?
{MClose}
{Color 08}Zalbaag{Newline}
{Color 00}I heard about Gariland. They say you{Newline}
made short work of those brigands.{Newline}
Now you've truly the right to call yourself{Newline}
a Beoulve. Father would be proud.
{MClose}
Thank you, Lord Brother.
{MClose}
Ha! You certainly haven't changed. Gods{Newline}
forbid you show a bit of cheer on being{Newline}
praised!{Newline}
And you, Delita! Do not think word of your{Newline}
deeds escapes our ears. Your sister's been{Newline}
so full of pride I quite feared she might burst!
{MClose}
{Color 08}Tietra{Newline}
{Color 00}Worry not, my seams have held. I'm{Newline}
glad to see you looking so well, Delita.
{MClose}
{Color 08}Delita{Newline}
{Color 00}And I you. Have you{Newline}
settled in at school?
{MClose}
Yes, the others have all been quite{Newline}
kind to me.
{MClose}
Would that we could speak at greater leisure,{Newline}
but there are duties that require my attendance.{Newline}
Rogues do not catch themselves.
{MClose}
I understand.{Newline}
Good luck.
{MClose}
We received a note of ransom{Newline}
from the Corpse Brigade.
{MClose}
{Color 08}Argath{Newline}
{Color 00}What!?
{MClose}
Something about it sits unwell with{Newline}
me.{Newline}
{Newline}
They are anarchists to be sure, bent{Newline}
on bringing down the aristocracy.{Newline}
{Newline}
But they fancy themselves righteous,{Newline}
and prey only on the nobility and{Newline}
those in our employ.{Newline}
Would such as they truly kidnap the{Newline}
marquis for want of coin?
{MClose}
Why wouldn't they? They're{Newline}
naught but common footpads!
{MClose}
One of the men I planted among them has{Newline}
not returned.{Newline}
{Newline}
I worry he may be caught up in something{Newline}
serious, but there are those who do not think{Newline}
some mere spy worth a search party's efforts.
{MClose}
Where was he last known to be?
{MClose}
A merchant city named Dorter in eastern{Newline}
Gallionne.{Newline}
{Newline}
Guarding a castle grows dreadfully dull.{Newline}
...Wouldn't you agree?
{MClose}
Forgive us, Tietra. It seems we must be{Newline}
leaving sooner than we had planned.
{MClose}
Don't worry about me—just take{Newline}
care of yourself.
{MClose}
I will. Mind your studies! I'll be back{Newline}
before you've even noticed I'm gone.
{MClose}
Let's be on our way.
{MClose}
{Color 08}Alma{Newline}
{Color 00}Tietra puts on a brave face, but the{Newline}
truth is not as honeyed as her words.
{MClose}
What do you mean?
{MClose}
She has a hard time of it at school.{Newline}
The others tease her for being lowborn.
{MClose}
...
{MClose}
Forgive me, I shouldn't have said anything.{Newline}
I'm sure you have worries enough of your{Newline}
own.{Newline}
Tietra will be all right. I'm here to look after{Newline}
her.
{MClose}
Then there is naught to worry about.{Newline}
But mind your own limits. You can't{Newline}
be responsible for everything.
{MClose}
Says the brother who never fails to do any{Newline}
and all that is expected of him.{Newline}
{Newline}
Don't lose sight of yourself,{Newline}
{Ramza}.{Newline}
{Newline}
You needn't let your life be ruled by the{Newline}
fact you were born a Beoulve.
{MClose}
Now you're starting to sound like Mother.{Newline}
Ha ha ha!
{MClose}
{Ramza}...

{Color 00}We know you're of the Brigade.{Newline}
There's no use hiding it.{Newline}
Out with it! What have you done{Newline}
with the marquis? Where are{Newline}
you holding him?
{MClose}
You were with your commander,{Newline}
Wiegraf, when we came upon you.{Newline}
Where has he gone?
{MClose}
Mayhap a beating would loosen{Newline}
your tongue!
{MClose}
{Color 08}{Ramza}{Newline}
{Color 00}Enough, Argath!
{MClose}
Hmph.
{MClose}
Listen well.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
A great host, with the Order at its van,{Newline}
prepares a sweeping campaign that will{Newline}
bring to book your turncloak Brigade.{Newline}
You will die. You will be hunted down to{Newline}
the last and slaughtered like the swine you{Newline}
are, for such is brigandry's reward.{Newline}
But you, pig, are a lucky one. Tell us what{Newline}
we wish to know, and you may yet keep{Newline}
your bacon. So, where is Wiegraf?
{MClose}
{Color 08}Swordsman{Newline}
{Color 00}How the bloody hell should I know?
{MClose}
I'll not bear your ribald tongue, rogue!{Newline}
Learn to guard it, if you'd not have it{Newline}
cut from your throat!
{MClose}
I am no...no rogue.
{MClose}
Tell that to the men you've robbed!
{MClose}
You nobles are...all the same. You think every{Newline}
man...born outside a castle's walls...less than{Newline}
human.{Newline}
We fought for this kingdom at peril of our{Newline}
very lives. Yet the moment the war was{Newline}
ended...you turned us out into the streets.{Newline}
What do you think makes you so special?{Newline}
Birth? Blood? What difference does it make?
{MClose}
You kidnap men for ransom, then dare{Newline}
ask the difference between us!?
{MClose}
No... The marquis's kidnapping was...no plan{Newline}
of Wiegraf's.
{MClose}
...?
{MClose}
He would never...hold a man for ransom.
{MClose}
Then who? Someone kidnapped the{Newline}
marquis Elmdore de Limberry.
{MClose}
...
{MClose}
Speak! If not you, then on whom{Newline}
would you pin the deed?
{MClose}
...It was Gustav.
{MClose}
Who is Gustav?
{MClose}
{Color 08}Delita{Newline}
{Color 00}Gustav Margriff—lieutenant{Newline}
commander of the Dead Men.
{MClose}
So the Corpse Brigade -was- behind{Newline}
the kidnapping!
{MClose}
No! We're not like Gustav! We fight{Newline}
to end the aristocracy, not to{Newline}
become it!{Newline}
To be treated as equals—as the{Newline}
men of honor we are!
{MClose}
What do maggots know of honor?
{MClose}
That's enough, Argath!
{MClose}
So where is this "Gustav"?
{MClose}
In...in the Sand Rat's Sietch.
{MClose}
Sand rat?
{MClose}
You are not of Gallionne—small{Newline}
wonder you've not heard of them.{Newline}
{Newline}
Sand rats are unique to the Zeklaus{Newline}
Desert, north of Dorter.
{MClose}
Do any villages lie between here and{Newline}
the desert?
{MClose}
Villages? No. At least, not anymore. But{Newline}
the desertmen once had a settlement on{Newline}
the outskirts, and its ruins remain.
{MClose}
Then that's where we'll find Gustav and{Newline}
the marquis.
{MClose}
Aye, like as not.
{MClose}
How can you be so certain?
{MClose}
A "sietch" is a sand rat's burrow—his home.

Let me walk free, and I will release the{Newline}

{Color 08}Lord Dycedarg Beoulve{Newline}
{Color 00}What madness possessed you that you would{Newline}
abandon your posts to traipse about the desert?
{MClose}
{Color 08}{Ramza}{Newline}
{Color 00}...
{MClose}
Silence is not the answer I seek.{Newline}
Speak, and be quick with it.
{MClose}
{Color 08}Delita{Newline}
{Color 00}'Twas I forced {Ramza}{Newline}
to go.
{MClose}
Was that the way of it, {Ramza}?{Newline}
Delita led your better judgment astray?
{MClose}
No...I went of my own choosing.{Newline}
The fault lies not with him.
{MClose}
'Tis {Ramza}'s noble disposition{Newline}
that guides his tongue, my lord.{Newline}
It is not as he—
{MClose}
You needn't be false on my behalf,{Newline}
Delita. It was I who chose to{Newline}
disregard orders.
{MClose}
Might I pose a question,{Newline}
{Ramza}?{Newline}
{Newline}
What purpose do laws serve when even those{Newline}
who would enforce them choose not to pay{Newline}
them heed?{Newline}
Adherence to the rule of law is a knight's{Newline}
solemn duty. It falls upon us, as Beoulves,{Newline}
to bear the burden of example.{Newline}
Is your intent to live up to your name—or{Newline}
to drag it with you through the mire?
{MClose}
...Forgive me, Lord Brother.
{MClose}
{Color 08}Man's Voice{Newline}
{Color 00}I believe the point is made, is it not,{Newline}
Dycedarg?
{MClose}
You must not let the how of it steal your{Newline}
eyes away from the what. Their rescue{Newline}
of the marquis was no small feat.{Newline}
It is the way of young men to be impetuous{Newline}
in their haste to do great things. We were{Newline}
not unlike them once.
{MClose}
To coddle them is to do them disservice,{Newline}
Your Grace. They need learn integrity.
{MClose}
{Color 08}Duke Larg{Newline}
{Color 00}So, you are Lord Dycedarg's younger brother.{Newline}
Rise, son of Gallionne.{Newline}
Indeed, you are the very ghost of Barbaneth.{Newline}
His fire burns in your eyes, I can see it.{Newline}
{Newline}
Such strength and vitality would be wasted{Newline}
atop castle walls.
{MClose}
Our campaign against the Corpse Brigade{Newline}
draws near its end. I will permit you to join{Newline}
in the final stage.{Newline}
Coordinated strikes are to be made on a {Newline}
number of their dens ere long. You will lead{Newline}
one of those assaults.
{MClose}
Very well, Lord Brother.
{MClose}
My apologies, Your Grace.
{MClose}
It was not of your doing, Dycedarg. In{Newline}
truth, it serves only to show the caliber{Newline}
of man we were dealing with in Gustav.{Newline}
A change in plans was inevitable, once{Newline}
the fool went and staged the kidnapping{Newline}
within our very borders.{Newline}
And let us not forget—they did save the {Newline}
marquis's life. He will now be honor-bound{Newline}
to acquiesce.{Newline}
In the end, your brother's deeds have{Newline}
placed us in quite the favorable position.
{MClose}
The king's life hangs by a thread.{Newline}
We must move quickly now.
{MClose}
Indeed, my dear friend. I trust you will{Newline}
not fail me.

But—!

Their leader yet eludes us, but time{Newline}

And for Tietra as well. You would{Newline}

I have taken measures to ensure{Newline}

{Color 00}Think matters through, Delita.{Newline}
Where would you even go?{Newline}
You must calm yourself!
{MClose}
{Color 08}Delita{Newline}
{Color 00}Calm myself? My only sister is taken by{Newline}
cutthroats, and you would have me calm?
{MClose}
I would have you obey reason! We know{Newline}
not where to begin. To search now would{Newline}
be fruitless.
{MClose}
Fruitless!? You speak{Newline}
of my sister's life!
{MClose}
You heard...my lord brother.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
He said he would not...abandon her.{Newline}
But there's little...we can do—{Newline}
Delita, I...cannot...breathe.
{MClose}
Forgive me, {Ramza}.{Newline}
Are you all right?
{MClose}
I...I'll be fine...{Newline}
*cough*
{MClose}
{Color 08}Argath{Newline}
{Color 00}I'd not believe a word of that{Newline}
fairy tale if I were you.
{MClose}
You call my brother a liar?
{MClose}
I do. I would not go out of -my- way{Newline}
to rescue some common maid.
{MClose}
What did you say?
{MClose}
I said he would be a fool to hold back{Newline}
an army for fear of spilling a few drops{Newline}
of your common blood!
{MClose}
As I thought.
{MClose}
Stop this, Delita!
{MClose}
Release me! Damn you, {Ramza},{Newline}
release me!
{MClose}
Hmph. It's as I've always said: Common{Newline}
blood, common man. You'll never be more{Newline}
than you were born, Delita!{Newline}
You don't belong in our world. You ought{Newline}
be licking our boots with the rest of your{Newline}
ilk, churl!
{MClose}
That does it—!
{MClose}
Enough, Delita!{Newline}
And you as well, Argath!
{MClose}
Open your eyes, {Ramza}!{Newline}
Delita is not one of us!{Newline}
{Newline}
It isn't proper that you should mix with{Newline}
such as he. Surely you see that?
{MClose}
Delita is my friend, and a dear one.{Newline}
We've been as brothers all our lives!
{MClose}
And that blinds you from the truth!{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
You're a man grown, {Ramza}.{Newline}
It's time you left the playthings of your{Newline}
boyhood behind.{Newline}
You are a son of House Beoulve, a birth{Newline}
high even among the highborn. Such company{Newline}
ill suits you.{Newline}
Your brothers see this, I am sure.{Newline}
Even if you choose not to.
{MClose}
Not everyone of high birth is as ill-bred as you.{Newline}
I'll trust to {Ramza}'s judgment.
{MClose}
Begone from my sight!{Newline}
And do not think to return!
{MClose}
Your words cut deep, {Ramza}.{Newline}
Are we not friends?
{MClose}
Remove yourself!{Newline}
I'll not ask again!
{MClose}
The Brigade makes its base at Ziekden.{Newline}
Your lord brother told me himself.{Newline}
{Newline}
You've no hope of breaching the fortress{Newline}
from the fore. Their defenses are too strong.{Newline}
A rear assault is your only chance.{Newline}
Best of luck, my soft-hearted friend.{Newline}
You'll need it.
{MClose}
Begone!

{Color 00}Why have you kidnapped this girl?
{MClose}
{Color 08}Gragoroth{Newline}
{Color 00}We had to take a hostage—there was{Newline}
no other way to escape.
{MClose}
{Color 08}Wiegraf{Newline}
{Color 00}Then why not release her once you{Newline}
were clear of your pursuers?{Newline}
Do not tell me this madness has taken{Newline}
even you!
{MClose}
I am no Gustav, if that is your fear!{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
Think, Wiegraf. We've lost the greater{Newline}
part of our number, and the Northern{Newline}
Order draws upon us from all sides.{Newline}
She is of Beoulve blood. A hundred{Newline}
swords—a thousand!—could not buy{Newline}
our freedom with such ease!
{MClose}
So we fly—what then? Know you some happy{Newline}
haven in which we may alight?{Newline}
{Newline}
If we flee, they win once more. As they{Newline}
have always won.{Newline}
{Newline}
We must make for our children a fairer{Newline}
future than the past you and I have known.{Newline}
They must not suffer as we do!{Newline}
The stone we cast might raise only the{Newline}
smallest of waves, but see how they crash{Newline}
upon the shore!{Newline}
Waves rich with our blood...
{MClose}
Then you order us to our deaths!?
{MClose}
If by our deaths a single drop of noble{Newline}
blood should water the earth, they shall{Newline}
not be in vain.
{MClose}
Foolishness! The only blood the earth{Newline}
will drink will be our own.
{MClose}
The remainder of our forces should yet{Newline}
be safe in our fastness at Ziekden.{Newline}
{Newline}
We must rejoin them—together we{Newline}
have the strength to strike!
{MClose}
And if they are already dead?
{MClose}
Milleuda? Slain?{Newline}
Impossible...
{MClose}
The company which slew her{Newline}
must approach even now.{Newline}
{Newline}
Your orders, Commander?
{MClose}
We quit this place at once!{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
We shall make for our fastness at{Newline}
Ziekden. The girl will be left here,{Newline}
Gragoroth.
{MClose}
{Color 08}Lookout{Newline}
{Color 00}The Northern Sky is upon us!{Newline}
They attack!
{MClose}
They waste little time.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
I shall hold them off here!{Newline}
Gragoroth, you will take the{Newline}
others and make for Ziekden!
{MClose}
I will run, yes. But I{Newline}
do not mean to die!

{Color 00}Your faces are known to me. But I did not know{Newline}
that you would one day kill my sister.{Newline}

even send proper knights to kill her!
{MClose}
{Color 08}{Ramza}{Newline}
{Color 00}She was your sister...{Newline}
I am sorry.

I will not flee before her murderers. I'll venge{Newline}

{Color 00}My sister, Tietra—you will set her free!

{Color 00}Your sister? Then you are a Beoulve, yes?
{MClose}
{Color 08}{Ramza}{Newline}
{Color 00}He is not. If it is a Beoulve you{Newline}
seek, address yourself to me!
{MClose}
So, Gragoroth has erred. But surely{Newline}
the girl must hold some connection{Newline}
with House Beoulve?
{MClose}
You draw no distinction between our{Newline}
house and those who deal with us?
{MClose}
Should I?{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
Well, it matters not. There was no{Newline}
question as to her release. We make{Newline}
no habit of holding hostages.{Newline}
But first we've a score to settle.{Newline}
You will see her free—if you live{Newline}
to see aught at all!
{MClose}
{Color 08}{Ramza}{Newline}
{Color 00}Lay down your arms, Wiegraf!{Newline}
What end will more deaths serve?
{MClose}
{Color 08}Wiegraf{Newline}
{Color 00}What end did my sister's death serve?
{MClose}
We did not set out to kill her!{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
This quarrel need not be settled by{Newline}
the sword. Let us treat, and persist{Newline}
not in this bloodshed!
{MClose}
You see it not—the reason we hold fast to{Newline}
our steel!{Newline}
{Newline}
What advantage might I hope to enjoy at the{Newline}
treaty table? And who would set a seat for{Newline}
me there? You?{Newline}
Even were it in your power, your brothers{Newline}
would never heed any agreement we might{Newline}
reach!
{MClose}
My brothers do not want this fight!{Newline}
Set down your sword, Wiegraf, and{Newline}
my brothers will treat with you!
{MClose}
Ha! No spoony bard could spin a sweeter{Newline}
tale!{Newline}
{Newline}
You say your brothers do not want this{Newline}
fight? Tears then, for the world you see{Newline}
is one beyond my weary sight.

Do not mock my brothers!

{Color 08}Wiegraf{Newline}

{Color 00}Wiegraf, wait!

Who do you think sent Gustav to{Newline}
kidnap Marquis Elmdore?{Newline}

It was none other than your lord{Newline}
brother, Dycedarg. With Lord{Newline}
Zalbaag's approval, to be sure.
{MClose}
Absurd! Why would Dycedarg{Newline}
do such a thing?
{MClose}
The Lions vie for power in the void left by{Newline}

I speak, of course, of Larg, the White Lion,{Newline}

{Newline}
Each hopes to learn who may be counted{Newline}
as friend, and who as foe. But such things{Newline}
are not so easily read.{Newline}
Easier rid yourself of those whose loyalty is{Newline}
uncertain, and install others to rule in their{Newline}
stead.{Newline}
I fear Gustav, fool that he was, tired of our{Newline}
rebellion, and was taken in by the silver{Newline}
tongue of your dear brother, Dycedarg.
{MClose}
Lies! No Beoulve would do a thing{Newline}
so craven as this!
{MClose}
Do not take my word for it. Judge their actions{Newline}
for yourself. Farewell, young Beoulve.

{Color 00}She was your sister...{Newline}
I am sorry.

I will not flee before her murderers. I'll venge{Newline}

{Color 00}My sister, Tietra—you will set her free!

So, Gragoroth has erred. But surely{Newline}

You draw no distinction between our{Newline}

Well, it matters not. There was no{Newline}

me there? You?{Newline}
Even were it in your power, your brothers{Newline}

{MClose}
She was Delita's sister!
{MClose}
Is it not time you awoke to the fact{Newline}
that we are different from them?{Newline}
{Newline}
They are of lesser birth, and so meant{Newline}
to play lesser roles in life! Such is the{Newline}

You? A puppet? Don't be absurd!{Newline}

{Newline}
A dance that serves our ends, to be sure.{Newline}
The Beoulve name is our shield, behind{Newline}

It is the way of things! People are used,{Newline}

{Color 08}Northern Sky Knight{Newline}
{Color 00}Stand aside, ser! You are defeated!{Newline}
{Newline}
Surrender the princess, and no more{Newline}
blood must needs be spilt!
{MClose}
{Color 08}Delita{Newline}
{Color 00}Do you so enjoy the taste of lies? Your{Newline}
orders are to see the princess dead!{Newline}
And once I've watched you feed the{Newline}
falls her blood, I'm to believe you'd{Newline}
let me live, a witness to your crime?
{MClose}
What foolishness is this? We came to{Newline}
save the princess, not kill her!{Newline}
{Newline}
What could we possibly gain by Lady{Newline}
Ovelia's death? We wish only to see{Newline}
her freed from the Black Lion's claws!
{MClose}
{Color 08}Agrias{Newline}
{Color 00}Your Highness!
{MClose}
{Color 08}Ovelia{Newline}
{Color 00}Agrias!
{MClose}
Hmm. It seems we are no longer alone.{Newline}
Gaffgarion! Kill them all!
{MClose}
A change of plans...but a contract is a{Newline}
contract, after all!
{MClose}
You would now betray us!?
{MClose}
Betray you? You have a viper's tongue,{Newline}
milady. I betray no one.{Newline}
{Newline}
I am in the Order's employ, and they are{Newline}
of it. My task was to see the princess{Newline}
safely abducted.{Newline}
And theirs, to see the one responsible{Newline}
silenced.
{MClose}
You mean to say the kidnapping was{Newline}
a ruse?
{MClose}
The princess is an obstacle to the throne.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
So long as she lives, the threat remains that{Newline}
someone could assert her claim above Prince{Newline}
Orinus's. Two heirs are one too many!
{MClose}
If her death is certain, then let it least not{Newline}
be in vain.{Newline}
{Newline}
Kill her if you must, but let it be held she{Newline}
was taken by Goltanna's men.{Newline}
{Newline}
Do that, and the stroke that fells a problem{Newline}
princess at once brings down a rival Lion.{Newline}
That was no doubt Larg's plan all along.{Newline}
...Or was it his? Such a plot has more the{Newline}
feel of Dycedarg's thinking.{Newline}
{Newline}
Would you not agree, {Ramza}?
{MClose}
That one has the right of it,{Newline}
{Ramza}.{Newline}
{Newline}
Come, let us earn our pay!
{MClose}
No...not again. I will not watch as{Newline}
sacrifices are made of the weak{Newline}
and innocent.{Newline}
She will not be another Tietra!
{MClose}
{Color 08}Agrias{Newline}
{Color 00}Hold on, Your Highness!{Newline}
I am coming to help!
{MClose}
{Color 08}Gaffgarion{Newline}
{Color 00}Do not be so sure of that!
{MClose}
Have you any idea what you do?{Newline}
The path you tread leads only{Newline}
to perdition!{Newline}
An adopted daughter she may be,{Newline}
but a daughter of kings no less!{Newline}
To lay a finger on her is treason!
{MClose}
Of that, I am well aware. But{Newline}
your daughter of kings stands{Newline}
in the way of kings-to-be!{Newline}
Princess or no, her worth is{Newline}
spent. And those born of kings{Newline}
do not outlive their worth.
{MClose}
Do you mean to mock her!?
{MClose}
No more than we are mocked. Have you{Newline}
once seen a man of royal blood stay his{Newline}
hand when a commoner blocked his way?{Newline}
The only difference is that those of royal{Newline}
blood are protected by lackwits like you, who{Newline}
swear fealty without even a thought!{Newline}
Even should the princess live, it would be{Newline}
only as a pawn in another's game. To kill{Newline}
her now is a mercy!
{MClose}
Then it is a mercy I will not see{Newline}
her done!
{MClose}
{Color 08}{Ramza}{Newline}
{Color 00}Delita! You live!
{MClose}
{Color 08}Delita{Newline}
{Color 00}So I do. And you, ever your lord{Newline}
brothers' faithful hound?
{MClose}
Are you mad? I knew naught{Newline}
of any of this!{Newline}
{Newline}
What of you, Delita? You now{Newline}
play party to their plot?
{MClose}
Surely you jape! I came to rescue{Newline}
the princess!{Newline}
{Newline}
I would not see her made a tool{Newline}
for others to use to their own ends!
{MClose}
{Color 08}Gaffgarion{Newline}
{Color 00}If you would lie, boy, at least lie well!{Newline}
You are no knight errant!{Newline}
You were paid to take the princess.{Newline}
Do not play the fool with me! Name{Newline}
the man who bought your sword!
{MClose}
I sell my sword to no one! Do{Newline}
not count me among your lot!
{MClose}
Spare me the lecture, I ask for a name!{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
You'd have me believe some bright-eyed{Newline}
pup caught wind of this plan and rescued{Newline}
the princess in the name of justice!?{Newline}
Who gives you your orders? Who told you{Newline}
of this plot!?
{MClose}
That is not for you to know!
{MClose}
{Color 08}Princess Ovelia{Newline}
{Color 00}Tell me, ser—are you friend or foe?
{MClose}
{Color 08}Delita{Newline}
{Color 00}I am a human being, no different{Newline}
from you.
{MClose}
{Color 08}Ovelia{Newline}
{Color 00}D-deliver me...O Lord...
{MClose}
{Color 08}{Ramza}{Newline}
{Color 00}No!{Newline}
{MClose}
{Color 08}{Ramza}{Newline}
{Color 00}You knew of this from the start! How could{Newline}
you dirty your hands with such tainted coin?
{MClose}
{Color 08}Gaffgarion{Newline}
{Color 00}Dirty? A man cannot sell his blade{Newline}
and think to keep it clean!{Newline}
I do what I am paid to do, and{Newline}
question not the details! That is{Newline}
the way of a sellsword.
{MClose}
Why did you not tell me!?
{MClose}
What would you have done if I had?{Newline}
Stopped me?{Newline}
{Newline}
The job would have been done,{Newline}
by our hands or no! It makes{Newline}
no difference in the end!{Newline}
Lives end every day with you none{Newline}
the wiser. You cannot save them{Newline}
all!{Newline}
Or are you so foolish as to believe{Newline}
you can?
{MClose}
But...but this isn't right!
{MClose}
What of it?{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
You are still a child—a child{Newline}
who will not see the world{Newline}
for what it is.{Newline}
A man does not turn his eyes{Newline}
from truth. A man accepts it,{Newline}
and walks the path he must.{Newline}
Do not chide me, when you{Newline}
cannot even choose a path{Newline}
for yourself!
{MClose}
{Color 08}Gaffgarion{Newline}
{Color 00}Damn it...

{MClose}
What foolishness is this? We came to{Newline}

Gaffgarion! Kill them all!
{MClose}
A change of plans...but a contract is a{Newline}

{MClose}
You would now betray us!?
{MClose}
Betray you? You have a viper's tongue,{Newline}
milady. I betray no one.{Newline}
{Newline}
I am in the Order's employ, and they are{Newline}
of it. My task was to see the princess{Newline}
safely abducted.{Newline}
And theirs, to see the one responsible{Newline}
silenced.
{MClose}
You mean to say the kidnapping was{Newline}
a ruse?
{MClose}
The princess is an obstacle to the throne.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
So long as she lives, the threat remains that{Newline}
someone could assert her claim above Prince{Newline}
Orinus's. Two heirs are one too many!
{MClose}
If her death is certain, then let it least not{Newline}
be in vain.{Newline}
{Newline}
Kill her if you must, but let it be held she{Newline}
was taken by Goltanna's men.{Newline}
{Newline}
Do that, and the stroke that fells a problem{Newline}
princess at once brings down a rival Lion.{Newline}
That was no doubt Larg's plan all along.{Newline}
...Or was it his? Such a plot has more the{Newline}
feel of Dycedarg's thinking.{Newline}
{Newline}
Would you not agree, {Ramza}?
{MClose}
That one has the right of it,{Newline}
{Ramza}.{Newline}
{Newline}
Come, let us earn our pay!
{MClose}
No...not again. I will not watch as{Newline}

Have you any idea what you do?{Newline}

An adopted daughter she may be,{Newline}
but a daughter of kings no less!{Newline}
To lay a finger on her is treason!
{MClose}
Of that, I am well aware. But{Newline}
your daughter of kings stands{Newline}
in the way of kings-to-be!{Newline}
Princess or no, her worth is{Newline}
spent. And those born of kings{Newline}
do not outlive their worth.
{MClose}
Do you mean to mock her!?
{MClose}
No more than we are mocked. Have you{Newline}
once seen a man of royal blood stay his{Newline}
hand when a commoner blocked his way?{Newline}
The only difference is that those of royal{Newline}
blood are protected by lackwits like you, who{Newline}
swear fealty without even a thought!{Newline}
Even should the princess live, it would be{Newline}
only as a pawn in another's game. To kill{Newline}
her now is a mercy!

What of you, Delita? You now{Newline}
play party to their plot?
{MClose}
Surely you jape! I came to rescue{Newline}

I sell my sword to no one! Do{Newline}
not count me among your lot!

{MClose}
Why did you not tell me!?

What would you have done if I had?{Newline}

You are still a child—a child{Newline}

{Color 08}Delita{Newline}
{Color 00}Do you so enjoy the taste of lies? Your{Newline}

And once I've watched you feed the{Newline}

{MClose}
What foolishness is this? We came to{Newline}
save the princess, not kill her!{Newline}
{Newline}
What could we possibly gain by Lady{Newline}
Ovelia's death? We wish only to see{Newline}
her freed from the Black Lion's claws!

{Color 00}Your Highness!

{Color 08}Ovelia{Newline}
{Color 00}Agrias!
{MClose}
Hmm. It seems we are no longer alone.{Newline}
Gaffgarion! Kill them all!
{MClose}
A change of plans...but a contract is a{Newline}
contract, after all!
{MClose}
You would now betray us!?
{MClose}
Betray you? You have a viper's tongue,{Newline}
milady. I betray no one.{Newline}
{Newline}
I am in the Order's employ, and they are{Newline}
of it. My task was to see the princess{Newline}
safely abducted.{Newline}
And theirs, to see the one responsible{Newline}
silenced.
{MClose}
You mean to say the kidnapping was{Newline}
a ruse?
{MClose}
The princess is an obstacle to the throne.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
So long as she lives, the threat remains that{Newline}
someone could assert her claim above Prince{Newline}
Orinus's. Two heirs are one too many!
{MClose}
If her death is certain, then let it least not{Newline}
be in vain.{Newline}
{Newline}
Kill her if you must, but let it be held she{Newline}
was taken by Goltanna's men.{Newline}
{Newline}
Do that, and the stroke that fells a problem{Newline}
princess at once brings down a rival Lion.{Newline}
That was no doubt Larg's plan all along.{Newline}
...Or was it his? Such a plot has more the{Newline}
feel of Dycedarg's thinking.{Newline}
{Newline}
Would you not agree, {Ramza}?
{MClose}
That one has the right of it,{Newline}
{Ramza}.{Newline}
{Newline}
Come, let us earn our pay!
{MClose}
No...not again. I will not watch as{Newline}
sacrifices are made of the weak{Newline}

{MClose}
Have you any idea what you do?{Newline}
The path you tread leads only{Newline}
to perdition!{Newline}
An adopted daughter she may be,{Newline}
but a daughter of kings no less!{Newline}
To lay a finger on her is treason!
{MClose}
Of that, I am well aware. But{Newline}
your daughter of kings stands{Newline}
in the way of kings-to-be!{Newline}
Princess or no, her worth is{Newline}
spent. And those born of kings{Newline}
do not outlive their worth.
{MClose}
Do you mean to mock her!?
{MClose}
No more than we are mocked. Have you{Newline}
once seen a man of royal blood stay his{Newline}
hand when a commoner blocked his way?{Newline}
The only difference is that those of royal{Newline}
blood are protected by lackwits like you, who{Newline}
swear fealty without even a thought!{Newline}
Even should the princess live, it would be{Newline}
only as a pawn in another's game. To kill{Newline}
her now is a mercy!

{Newline}
What of you, Delita? You now{Newline}
play party to their plot?
{MClose}
Surely you jape! I came to rescue{Newline}

I sell my sword to no one! Do{Newline}
not count me among your lot!
{MClose}
Spare me the lecture, I ask for a name!{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
You'd have me believe some bright-eyed{Newline}

{Color 00}No!{Newline}

{Color 00}You knew of this from the start! How could{Newline}
you dirty your hands with such tainted coin?

{Color 00}Dirty? A man cannot sell his blade{Newline}
and think to keep it clean!{Newline}
I do what I am paid to do, and{Newline}

the way of a sellsword.
{MClose}
Why did you not tell me!?
{MClose}
What would you have done if I had?{Newline}
Stopped me?{Newline}
{Newline}
The job would have been done,{Newline}
by our hands or no! It makes{Newline}
no difference in the end!{Newline}

Or are you so foolish as to believe{Newline}

But...but this isn't right!

You are still a child—a child{Newline}

{Newline}
So long as she lives, the threat remains that{Newline}
someone could assert her claim above Prince{Newline}
Orinus's. Two heirs are one too many!
{MClose}
If her death is certain, then let it least not{Newline}
be in vain.{Newline}
{Newline}
Kill her if you must, but let it be held she{Newline}
was taken by Goltanna's men.{Newline}
{Newline}
Do that, and the stroke that fells a problem{Newline}
princess at once brings down a rival Lion.{Newline}
That was no doubt Larg's plan all along.{Newline}
...Or was it his? Such a plot has more the{Newline}
feel of Dycedarg's thinking.{Newline}
{Newline}
Would you not agree, {Ramza}?
{MClose}
That one has the right of it,{Newline}

{Newline}
Come, let us earn our pay!

To lay a finger on her is treason!
{MClose}
Of that, I am well aware. But{Newline}
your daughter of kings stands{Newline}

Princess or no, her worth is{Newline}
spent. And those born of kings{Newline}
do not outlive their worth.
{MClose}
Do you mean to mock her!?
{MClose}
No more than we are mocked. Have you{Newline}

The only difference is that those of royal{Newline}

Even should the princess live, it would be{Newline}

{Color 00}Street dogs running for the Baert Trading{Newline}
Company.
{MClose}
{Color 08}Agrias{Newline}
{Color 00}-The- Baert Trading Company?
{MClose}
Ah, then you've heard of them. But they're no{Newline}
ordinary traders.{Newline}
{Newline}
That business is only a front for more...lucrative{Newline}
pursuits. Opium smuggling, slave trading—all{Newline}
manner of vile thing, on a grand scale.
{MClose}
{Color 08}{Ramza}{Newline}
{Color 00}What did you do to draw the attention of{Newline}
such as these?
{MClose}
I'm a machinist. Do you know the history of{Newline}
my trade?
{MClose}
They say the ruins of a lost civilization lie{Newline}
buried beneath the streets of Goug, the{Newline}
Clockwork City.{Newline}
Relics from the age of Saint Ajora, when{Newline}
airships numerous beyond counting filled the {Newline}
skies, and men of iron walked city streets.{Newline}
But the art of crafting such things was{Newline}
lost—if it ever truly existed at all.
{MClose}
But it -did- exist.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
The ground beneath Goug holds the hulks of{Newline}
airships, and a thousand fragments of machines{Newline}
the gods alone know the workings of.{Newline}
A machinist toils to restore this lost legacy—{Newline}
to see these works brought to life again.
{MClose}
The device you used during the battle—is{Newline}
that one of these machines?
{MClose}
What, this?{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
This is a weapon called a "pistol." It uses an{Newline}
explosive powder to propel a metal projectile{Newline}
toward its target.{Newline}
This one is of simple make. There were once{Newline}
pistols said to fire projectiles infused with{Newline}
magicks.
{MClose}
Hmm.
{MClose}
So why do these hounds of the Baert{Newline}
Trading Company chase after you?
{MClose}
You said you were going to see Cardinal{Newline}
Delacroix, yes?{Newline}
{Newline}
The cardinal is a hero who fought in the{Newline}
Fifty Years' War. To this day the people{Newline}
of Lionel honor him as such.{Newline}
As does my father. He believes that the{Newline}
cardinal is the only man who can keep the{Newline}
realm from descending into chaos.{Newline}
The cardinal will receive you, hear your{Newline}
plea. And the princess will be safe.
{MClose}
And what is it -you- want?
{MClose}
To go with you. I have my own reason for{Newline}
wanting to speak with the cardinal.
{MClose}
That being?
{MClose}
To save my father!{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
He is held prisoner. The cardinal is my{Newline}
only hope to free him!{Newline}
{Newline}
Alone, I am just another machinist—the{Newline}
cardinal would never see me. That's why{Newline}
I would join you.
{MClose}
You still haven't answered my question.{Newline}
Why is the Baert Trading Company so{Newline}
interested in you?
{MClose}
I...I cannot tell you. Not now.
{MClose}
Then you remain here.
{MClose}
No! I must see the cardinal!{Newline}
You must trust me, please!
{MClose}
{Color 08}Ovelia{Newline}
{Color 00}Very well, then. You will come with us.
{MClose}
You mean it? Thank you, my lady.{Newline}
Thank you!
{MClose}
You stand before the princess!
{MClose}
There is no need. You may rise.
{MClose}
Then it's settled. We will trust to your word.

{Color 00}Lionel Castle, Highness. Do you see it?{Newline}
Just beyond those mountains.
{MClose}
{Color 08}Ovelia{Newline}
{Color 00}We still have a long journey ahead.{Newline}
{Newline}
Do you think Cardinal Delacroix{Newline}
will aid us?
{MClose}
The cardinal is said to be a man with utmost{Newline}
devotion to the Crown, Highness.{Newline}
{Newline}
Even amid this turmoil he has held the middle{Newline}
ground, siding with neither Duke Larg, nor{Newline}
Duke Goltanna.{Newline}
I do not think him a man to sully his honor by{Newline}
handing you over to either side.
{MClose}
I pray you are right.
{MClose}
He has influence with the Church of Glabados.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
A word from him, and the Church itself will{Newline}
take you under its protection.
{MClose}
Would that I were born no princess.
{MClose}
My lady...
{MClose}
My entire life has been spent behind sacred{Newline}
walls. The only sky I've known, hemmed in{Newline}
by slate and stone.{Newline}
Did you know, before I was sent to Orbonne,{Newline}
I was in another monastery?{Newline}
{Newline}
When I heard I was to be the adopted daughter{Newline}
of the late king, and after—ever in a{Newline}
monastery.{Newline}
It's not been such a bad life, I suppose.{Newline}
Only...{Newline}
{Newline}
Only, knowing that men die, for no more{Newline}
reason than that I am the princess—it's{Newline}
almost more than I can bear.
{MClose}
Highness, you must not blame yourself.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
The fault lies with those who would use you for{Newline}
their own ends.
{MClose}
There was another girl at Orbonne.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
She told me she, too, had lived her{Newline}
entire life within monastery halls.{Newline}
{Newline}
We joked that we two should share{Newline}
so strange a fate. *sigh* A funny{Newline}
thing to laugh at, don't you think?
{MClose}
You speak of Lady Alma, of House Beoulve.
{MClose}
My only true friend.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
What if Cardinal Delacroix makes{Newline}
to use me, like all the rest?
{MClose}
...
{MClose}
{Color 08}Mustadio{Newline}
{Color 00}{Ramza}! Where have you gotten{Newline}
off to? It's almost time to leave!
{MClose}
I didn't think to find you here.{Newline}
What are you doing?
{MClose}
What news have you?
{MClose}
All is quiet. It would seem the Northern Order{Newline}
hasn't reached Zaland, for the time.
{MClose}
A friend once showed me how to do this.{Newline}
But I'm afraid I've never quite gotten it right.
{MClose}
{Color 08}{Ramza}{Newline}
{Color 00}Just like that—it's simple, you see?
{MClose}
Like this?
{MClose}
It's really not so hard, is it?

{Color 00}Our little mockingbird is taken wing, Gaffgarion,{Newline}
and it leaves me wroth.{Newline}
We cannot have her free. Catch her, crush{Newline}
her, and make silent her song. Lady Agrias's{Newline}
and the others' as well.
{MClose}
{Color 08}Gaffgarion{Newline}
{Color 00}And {Ramza}?
{MClose}
The fool. He soils our name, dogs{Newline}
my every move.{Newline}
{Newline}
I thought this a chance to let him{Newline}
learn the harsh truths of the world.{Newline}
But the boy is too stubborn.
{MClose}
Too much of his father's penchant{Newline}
for justice, that one.
{MClose}
Father coddled the boy too much.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
If he stands aside, more the better.{Newline}
Should he interfere, there's naught{Newline}
can be done.
{MClose}
And you his brother.{Newline}
The blood curdles.
{MClose}
If the cardinal moves to defend{Newline}
the mockingbird, what then?{Newline}
{Newline}
Duke Larg himself could not{Newline}
reach them in umbrage of the{Newline}
Church's wing.
{MClose}
Worry not. That potentiality has been{Newline}
addressed.
{MClose}
Ever three steps ahead. You are a{Newline}
frightening man, Dycedarg Beoulve.
{MClose}
Truly? Would it not be prudent, then,{Newline}
to better guard your tongue?{Newline}
{Newline}
There are so many frightening ways{Newline}
to silence a bothersome one.
{MClose}
Come now, my lord, I am your{Newline}
ever-faithful man!{Newline}
{Newline}
And not near so stubborn as a{Newline}
particular Knight Devout—if I{Newline}
might be so bold.
{MClose}
Be bold. But let there be no more{Newline}
missteps.
{MClose}
On the matter of missteps, what{Newline}
buffoon did you charge with the{Newline}
princess's kidnapping?{Newline}
We were beset in Dorter as we{Newline}
gave chase. Not quite how we'd{Newline}
discussed, I'm sure you'd agree.
{MClose}
The men I sent were found dead in{Newline}
the woods near the monastery.{Newline}
{Newline}
Someone has caught wind of our plan,{Newline}
and seems intent on disrupting it.{Newline}
{Newline}
No matter. As long as Ovelia remains{Newline}
with Lady Agrias, we will have chance{Newline}
enough to steal back our prize.

I pray you're right,{Newline}
for both our sakes.

{Color 08}Cardinal Delacroix{Newline}
{Color 00}I see, Lady Agrias.{Newline}
{Newline}
In such circumstance as this, I am fain to lend{Newline}
you whatever help I can.{Newline}
{Newline}
I shall dispatch a courier to Mullonde at once.{Newline}
High Confessor Marcel will have this news{Newline}
from my own hand.{Newline}
We will expose Duke Larg's misdeeds, and ensure{Newline}
that no harm befall you, Princess.
{MClose}
Your Eminence, think you the High Confessor{Newline}
will hear our plea?
{MClose}
Fear not, dear lady. You are in my care now.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
Princess Ovelia can scarce feel at ease while{Newline}
those tasked with her safety are vexed with{Newline}
such worriment.{Newline}
You may enjoy the comforts of the castle—{Newline}
wanting though they are—while we await a{Newline}
reply from Mullonde.
{MClose}
{Color 08}Ovelia{Newline}
{Color 00}You are most gracious, Eminence. Thank you.
{MClose}
So long as Saint Ajora is our guide, we have{Newline}
naught to fear, child.{Newline}
{Newline}
As for you, my young machinist, I have given{Newline}
consideration to your troubles as well.{Newline}
{Newline}
I will send a hand-picked company of my finest{Newline}
men to Goug to put an end to this Baert{Newline}
Trading Company.
{MClose}
{Color 08}Mustadio{Newline}
{Color 00}Thank you, Your Eminence.
{MClose}
Conditioned upon this: I would hear the reason{Newline}
they choose to pursue you and your father.
{MClose}
That is—I mean to say it's not—
{MClose}
Come, come. Mayhap this will{Newline}
give voice to your words.
{MClose}
A crystal?
{MClose}
You are familiar with the legend of{Newline}
the Zodiac Braves?
{MClose}
In my youth, I often heard a fanciful{Newline}
tale of that name at mass.
{MClose}
What's this? Surely, Lady Agrias, you{Newline}
do not aver that the Church would{Newline}
mislead its flock?
{MClose}
No—no, of course not, Your Eminence.
{MClose}
Long ago, before the mountains had ceased their{Newline}
wandering and struck their roots into the earth,{Newline}
the Lucavi held dominion over the world.{Newline}
Twelve heroes there were, who came forward{Newline}
to challenge these Lucavi.{Newline}
{Newline}
In a long and bitter struggle, they succeeded{Newline}
in driving the Lucavi to the spirit world, and{Newline}
Ivalice again knew peace.{Newline}
The Twelve each bore an auracite crystal{Newline}
emblazoned with a house of the night sky.{Newline}
{Newline}
And so in time, they became known as the{Newline}
Zodiac Braves.{Newline}
{Newline}
Ever after, when discord and strife paid visit{Newline}
to the halls of men, they would return to save{Newline}
us once more.
{MClose}
You have clearly been a most apt pupil,{Newline}
Princess.
{MClose}
Elder Simon himself instructed me at{Newline}
Orbonne—which reminds me of another{Newline}
thing he said.{Newline}
Saint Ajora walked with the Twelve, and {Newline}
together they saved Ivalice from ruin.
{MClose}
We call the crystals of the Twelve{Newline}
the "Zodiac Stones."{Newline}
{Newline}
The stone you see before you now{Newline}
is a stone from that very legend.
{MClose}
Auracite—it exists? I did not think it possible.
{MClose}
Or that it held the sacred power to keep the{Newline}
Lucavi at bay, eh?{Newline}
{Newline}
I confess, I feel some power deep within, but{Newline}
my eyes see only a common crystal.
{MClose}
{Color 08}{Ramza}{Newline}
{Color 00}Mustadio, are you well? The color has{Newline}
left your face.
{MClose}
You have seen a stone like this one{Newline}
beneath Goug, have you not?
{MClose}
Machines whose fires have long since{Newline}
guttered out lie strewn in the tunnels{Newline}
beneath the city.{Newline}
But pass that Stone near them, and you{Newline}
can hear them stir.
{MClose}
Then Baert seeks the auracite, eh?
{MClose}
I do not know what power these Zodiac{Newline}
Stones hold.{Newline}
{Newline}
I know only that Ludovich Baert hopes to{Newline}
find some way to harness this power, and{Newline}
make a fearsome weapon.{Newline}
My father would not give them the Stone,{Newline}
so they took him instead.
{MClose}
Put your worries from your mind, my{Newline}
young machinist.{Newline}
{Newline}
The Church will see this matter is dealt{Newline}
with. Our forces will strike, and wrest{Newline}
the Stone from their hands.
{MClose}
Of...of course, Your Eminence.
{MClose}
I will join the company that makes for Goug.
{MClose}
Thank you, {Ramza}.
{MClose}
We would never have succeeded in reaching{Newline}
His Eminence the Cardinal without you,{Newline}
{Ramza}.{Newline}
You have my thanks, as well.
{MClose}
I can only wish you well—small aid, I know.
{MClose}
Your words are all the aid I could ever ask.

{Color 00}Are you all right?

{Color 08}Besrudio{Newline}
{Color 00}My wounds will heal. But the auracite—they{Newline}
have it.{Newline}
Ludovich will use it to wake the machines{Newline}
beneath the city.{Newline}
{Newline}
In time, he may even learn to harness the{Newline}
sacred power of the Stone itself.{Newline}
{Newline}
*sigh* I never thought the man we'd turn to{Newline}
for help would turn on us. There's naught we{Newline}
could do to foresee such treachery.
{MClose}
Ha. Are you sure?
{MClose}
What do you mean?
{MClose}
I thought something of the sort might happen,{Newline}
so I took the precaution of readying a false{Newline}
stone.
{MClose}
{Color 08}{Ramza}{Newline}
{Color 00}And that's the one I gave Ludovich!
{MClose}
The same. By now they've probably realized.{Newline}
Ah, to see the looks on their faces.
{MClose}
Then Princess Ovelia and Lady Agrias are{Newline}
in danger!
{MClose}
Danger? How?
{MClose}
The cardinal was working with Ludovich{Newline}
to get the Stone.{Newline}
{Newline}
His gambit failed, but he may try to ransom{Newline}
the princess and Lady Agrias for it now{Newline}
instead.
{MClose}
That's ridiculous! He would only make an enemy{Newline}
of the Crown!
{MClose}
Why do you think he wants the auracite in the{Newline}
first place?{Newline}
{Newline}
The people tire of war. They tire of these{Newline}
endless struggles for power. They are afraid,{Newline}
and they seek salvation.{Newline}
The cardinal means to use the legend of the{Newline}
Zodiac Braves to bring it to them.{Newline}
{Newline}
Only once he's gathered the Stones, he'll{Newline}
summon the Zodiac Braves and use their{Newline}
power to rule.
{MClose}
Just so. We cannot give the{Newline}
Stone to the cardinal.
{MClose}
Then we must rescue the{Newline}
princess and Lady Agrias!
{MClose}
And we will. But the roads leading to{Newline}
Lionel Castle will surely be blockaded.{Newline}
{Newline}
We'll never be able to approach from{Newline}
the fore. We go by ship, to take them{Newline}
unawares.

{Color 08}Cardinal Delacroix{Newline}
{Color 00}Still your tongue, Ludovich.{Newline}
{Newline}
We will hand Princess Ovelia over to{Newline}
Lord Dycedarg as promised. That{Newline}
much serves us both.{Newline}
But it is no concern of mine if those{Newline}
who know the truth of her kidnapping{Newline}
live. I had no hand in it.{Newline}
Be that as it may, the thieves who{Newline}
stole the gem are now with them.{Newline}
{Newline}
If we use the princess to lure them{Newline}
out, we get two birds—and one Stone.
{MClose}
I won't deny the truth of it.{Newline}
But such a plan has risks.
{MClose}
Your reputation would not cast you{Newline}
so craven.
{MClose}
I am -cautious-, Your Holiness.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
A soldier does not live to become old{Newline}
and gray charging onto the field of{Newline}
battle unawares.
{MClose}
Very well. I will see that every{Newline}
possible precaution is taken.{Newline}
{Newline}
And let us sprinkle a trail of crumbs{Newline}
to ensure they find our snare.
{MClose}
A prudent move. The maid's the perfect{Newline}
bait to lure them to us.{Newline}
{Newline}
I'll assume responsibility for the rest.{Newline}
Far better me than -him-.
{MClose}
How -dare- you!
{MClose}
Very well. I shall leave the matter to{Newline}
you, Gaffgarion.
{MClose}
Your Eminence, you jape, surely!
{MClose}
Go with my blessing.
{MClose}
The Stone is good as yours.
{MClose}
Your Eminence, you cannot mean{Newline}
to trust this to a man like -that-!
{MClose}
I trust things to those who can be{Newline}
trusted. Men who fail me time and{Newline}
again are rewarded in another way.
{MClose}
Y-Your Eminence, wh-what are{Newline}
you doing!?

{Color 00}You've not touched your supper. A{Newline}
princess cannot live on pride alone.
{MClose}
{Color 08}Ovelia{Newline}
{Color 00}...
{MClose}
Do you think to starve yourself?{Newline}
None would weep, you know.{Newline}
{Newline}
There are many who would be{Newline}
gladdened by your passing. Stop{Newline}
being stubborn and eat.
{MClose}
You were in league with the cardinal{Newline}
all along, weren't you?{Newline}
{Newline}
What do you mean to do with me?{Newline}
If you'd not give me over to Larg,{Newline}
then what is your intent?
{MClose}
To put you where you truly ought{Newline}
to be.
{MClose}
So, you would manipulate me as well.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
I'll not do it, you know. I'll not bend{Newline}
to your whims.
{MClose}
You will. If you wish to survive,{Newline}
you have no other choice.
{MClose}
What do you mean?
{MClose}
I mean—
{MClose}
{Color 08}Knight{Newline}
{Color 00}So, this is Lady Ovelia...
{MClose}
{Color 08}Cardinal Delacroix{Newline}
{Color 00}Do your spirits find you well,{Newline}
Your Highness?{Newline}
If you would be but a tad more tame,{Newline}
there would be no reason to keep{Newline}
you in so cheerless a place as this.
{MClose}
{Color 08}Knight{Newline}
{Color 00}These seem lavish enough quarters{Newline}
for a false princess.
{MClose}
Ho ho ho... The girl does not yet know,{Newline}
Lord Folmarv.
{MClose}
{Color 08}Folmarv{Newline}
{Color 00}Truly? How pitiable.
{MClose}
Tell me of what it is you speak!
{MClose}
Very well.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
You are not Ovelia Atkascha.
{MClose}
What...?
{MClose}
The true princess died years ago.{Newline}
You are her double.
{MClose}
That's absurd!
{MClose}
It is neither absurd nor untrue. You are -not-{Newline}
Ovelia.{Newline}
{Newline}
You are a straw doll placed in an empty crib{Newline}
by Council members who bear no love for{Newline}
the queen.{Newline}
It was their intent that you would someday{Newline}
succeed the throne and relieve Queen{Newline}
Louveria of her power.{Newline}
They placed you in the royal family after{Newline}
assassinating the queen's two eldest sons,{Newline}
attributing their deaths to malady.{Newline}
The deception was complete, and your ascent{Newline}
all but sealed. King Ondoria was sickly, and{Newline}
seemed unlike to father another son.{Newline}
But against all odds, another prince was{Newline}
born. Whether he is in truth of Ondoria's{Newline}
seed is highly suspect, of course.{Newline}
Like as not, Duke Larg found some other{Newline}
sire to ensure his sister's place as mother{Newline}
to the king.{Newline}
Regardless, all of the Council's work was{Newline}
made for naught the moment Prince Orinus{Newline}
drew his first breath.
{MClose}
You speak false! I'll not believe you!
{MClose}
Believe what you like, child. It is of little{Newline}
enough consequence.{Newline}
{Newline}
You may be born a butcher's daughter{Newline}
for all it concerns us.{Newline}
{Newline}
We hold a trump card in our hands. The{Newline}
stock from which it was cut matters not.
{MClose}
What is it you wish of me, then?{Newline}
What would you have me do?
{MClose}
Naught at all, sweet child. We only wish{Newline}
that you be our princess, as you always{Newline}
have.
{MClose}
I am a daughter of House Atkascha!{Newline}
I'll take no orders from you!
{MClose}
Oh? Then what will you do? Let yourself{Newline}
fall into Duke Larg's hands, and you'll have{Newline}
a noose in place of a crown.{Newline}
We only wish to help you claim the throne{Newline}
that is yours by right.
{MClose}
...Who -are- you?
{MClose}
We are no friends of Duke Larg, nor{Newline}
do we sit in Goltanna's camp.{Newline}
{Newline}
Think of us simply as...allies.
{MClose}
Lord Folmarv, let us leave our{Newline}
princess to collect her thoughts.{Newline}
{Newline}
When she comes to see the reality{Newline}
of her situation, she will doubtless{Newline}
wish to be our ally as well.
{MClose}
Indeed, let us give her{Newline}
time to stew.
{MClose}
Come, Delita!

Surely the cardinal was no greater evil{Newline}
than this!

{Color 08}Cúchulainn, the Impure{Newline}
{Color 00}Behold Lucavi pow'r made manifest!{Newline}
Whose might o'er all Creation once held sway.
{MClose}
The power of the Lucavi?{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
I see only a devil before me! What have you{Newline}
done with the cardinal?
{MClose}
What nonsense this? I am the man himself!{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
Or rather he who once was Delacroix!{Newline}

The Stone, the auracite, such pow'rs grant,{Newline}
to rise above Man's frailty—a god.{Newline}

A god who brooks no meddling of fools!{Newline}
Die, and know suff'ring!

{Color 08}Cúchulainn, the Impure{Newline}

{Color 08}Duke Goltanna{Newline}
{Color 00}My advisors tell me you are the one who rescued{Newline}
Princess Ovelia. I would have you tell me more.
{MClose}
{Color 08}Delita{Newline}
{Color 00}I am Delita Heiral, a Blackram lieutenant in the {Newline}
service of His Excellency the Baron Grimms.{Newline}
His Excellency dispatched me to rescue the{Newline}
princess. And so I did, disguised as one of your{Newline}
own—a sheep in Lion's clothing.{Newline}
Now I have returned.
{MClose}
{Color 08}Chancellor Glevanne{Newline}
{Color 00}Heiral, you say? That is a name I've not{Newline}
heard before.
{MClose}
{Color 08}Duke Goltanna{Newline}
{Color 00}I thought Baron Grimms and his Blackrams{Newline}
felled in battle against the Eye a fortnight past.
{MClose}
Indeed. That dark news spurred me to{Newline}
return with all the greater haste.
{MClose}
How fares the princess?
{MClose}
{Color 08}Bishop Canne-Beurich{Newline}
{Color 00}She is weary yet from her long journey.{Newline}
She sleeps as if among the dead.
{MClose}
{Color 08}Count Cidolfus Orlandeau{Newline}
{Color 00}Is it not true you brought a prisoner?
{MClose}
It is.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
Bring the prisoner forth!
{MClose}
Let us hear the reason for your{Newline}
attempt on the princess.
{MClose}
{Color 08}Prisoner{Newline}
{Color 00}'Twas to stain Duke Goltanna's{Newline}
name, and keep him from Lesalia.{Newline}
We thought to deny him the regent's{Newline}
seat.
{MClose}
Who gave you the order?{Newline}
Duke Larg?
{MClose}
No...a close adviser of Duke Goltanna's{Newline}
seeking to curry Duke Larg's favor.
{MClose}
{Color 08}Chancellor Glevanne{Newline}
{Color 00}Madness! None among us would{Newline}
fain betray our duke!{Newline}
Silence this man, he knows not{Newline}
of what he speaks!
{MClose}
I would hear it nonetheless.
{MClose}
Who was it?
{MClose}
...
{MClose}
Name the one who gave the order!
{MClose}
I'd have your protection?
{MClose}
On my honor as a knight.{Newline}
Speak!
{MClose}
'Twas the man who stands before me.{Newline}
Chancellor Glevanne.
{MClose}
What!? How dare you! I do not even{Newline}
know you, knave!
{MClose}
Who put you to it?{Newline}
The queen?
{MClose}
Stop this mummer's farce,{Newline}
I've naught to do with this!
{MClose}
To betray your liege lord is an{Newline}
unpardonable crime, Chancellor.
{MClose}
It was not I! I know naught of it!
{MClose}
Forgive me if I presume overmuch, Your{Newline}
Grace, but now is not the time for{Newline}
bandied words.{Newline}
The Order of the Southern Sky must{Newline}
march on Lesalia at once, and you with{Newline}
it!{Newline}
Give your enemies but a moment to{Newline}
collect themselves, and they will pin{Newline}
the chancellor's sedition on his lord.{Newline}
Your Grace must strike before they are{Newline}
given the chance! Deny the prince's claim,{Newline}
and set the princess on the throne!
{MClose}
{Delay 02}Following his sack of{Delay 01}{Newline}
{Delay 02}the royal capital of Lesalia{Delay 0F},{Delay 01}{Newline}
{Delay 02}Duke Goltanna banished Queen Louveria{Delay 01}{Newline}
{Delay 02}to Besselat for her hand in the conspiracy{Delay 01}{Newline}
{Delay 02}and crowned Princess Ovelia queen{Delay 3C}.{Delay 01}{Newline}
{Newline}
{Delay 02}But Duke Larg{Delay 0F},{Delay 02} insisting{Delay 01}{Newline}
{Delay 02}that Prince Orinus was{Delay 01}{Newline}
{Delay 02}the true and rightful heir{Delay 0F},{Delay 01}{Newline}
{Delay 02}at once crowned the child-prince{Delay 01}{Newline}
{Delay 02}and declared himself regent{Delay 3C}.{Delay 01}{Newline}
{Newline}
{Delay 02}Moving then to free the queen{Delay 0F},{Delay 01}{Newline}
{Delay 02}Duke Larg dispatched the{Delay 01}{Newline}
{Delay 02}Order of the Northern Sky to Besselat{Delay 01}{Newline}
{Delay 02}in the name of the new-crowned king{Delay 1E}.{Delay 01}{Newline}
{Delay 02}Duke Goltanna in turn set the Southern Sky{Delay 01}{Newline}
{Delay 02}to march in Ovelia's name{Delay 3C}.{Delay 01}{Newline}
{Newline}

{Color 08}The Baron of Bolmina{Newline}
{Color 00}This past evenfall, the count stood at twenty{Newline}
thousand—forty, if both sides be counted.{Newline}
Alone, we've sustained, ah, two hundred{Newline}
thousand wounded, as well.
{MClose}
{Color 08}Marquis Elmdore de Limberry{Newline}
{Color 00}The number of casualties does not concern{Newline}
me.{Newline}
Nor does the depletion of our stores—these{Newline}
were to be expected. No, it is this drought{Newline}
that threatens us.{Newline}
The markets are empty and tax collections fall{Newline}
short. With prices as they are, we can lay in{Newline}
supplies for another half year, at best.
{MClose}
{Color 08}Viscount Blanche{Newline}
{Color 00}Duke Larg must surely face like difficulties.{Newline}
{Newline}
It rained unceasingly in Gallionne this season.{Newline}
The grain rotted in the fields before it could be{Newline}
harvested.
{MClose}
{Color 08}Count Cidolfus Orlandeau{Newline}
{Color 00}The real trouble lies in war's wake. There is{Newline}
no work. Whole villages have been displaced.{Newline}
Orran tells me over one hundred thousand{Newline}
have already fled to Lesalia, and more pour{Newline}
in by the day.
{MClose}
{Color 08}Viscount Blanche{Newline}
{Color 00}Ha! I see no trouble in this! Let Larg struggle{Newline}
to feed the mewling maids and his soldiers both!
{MClose}
{Color 08}Count Cidolfus Orlandeau{Newline}
{Color 00}It is no laughing matter! Should the conflict{Newline}
spread, we may find ourselves no better off.    {Newline}
Think you Zeltennia proof against such fate?{Newline}
I assure you, we are not!{Newline}
{Newline}
Has not the time come to chart a course to{Newline}
peace?
{MClose}
{Color 08}Duke Goltanna{Newline}
{Color 00}Your fears are well founded. But we cannot{Newline}
yet end this war.{Newline}
We shall treble the rate of tax, and keep a{Newline}
close watch on those who hope to profiteer{Newline}
in these trying times.{Newline}
As for those seeking refuge outside the castle{Newline}
walls, we shall tighten our patrols at the{Newline}
Limberry border to see they are turned back.
{MClose}
{Color 08}Count Cidolfus Orlandeau{Newline}
{Color 00}Duke Larg suffers, as do we. What better{Newline}
time to treat for peace?
{MClose}
{Color 08}Duke Goltanna{Newline}
{Color 00}You talk in circles, Orlandeau. There can be no{Newline}
peaceful end to this.
{MClose}
{Color 08}Count Cidolfus Orlandeau{Newline}
{Color 00}The kingdom cannot exist without her people,{Newline}
Excellency! No more than can we.{Newline}
In the Fifty Years' War, who bore a greater{Newline}
burden than they? Would you thank them now{Newline}
with higher taxes?{Newline}
And it is not only the people. Our soldiers{Newline}
are made to fight on rations that would{Newline}
scarce feed a child at his mother's skirts.{Newline}
We cannot long sustain this war. It is a{Newline}
matter of resources and resolve.
{MClose}
{Color 08}Duke Goltanna{Newline}
{Color 00}Resolve? Have you any? These are the words{Newline}
of a coward.
{MClose}
{Color 08}Count Cidolfus Orlandeau{Newline}
{Color 00}The Fifty Years' War was fought to drive{Newline}
back an invasion of our sovereign soil.{Newline}
We were honorbound to fight!
{MClose}
{Color 08}Duke Goltanna{Newline}
{Color 00}And in -this- war you do not feel so bound?{Newline}
{Newline}
You were never one given to hypocrisy,{Newline}
Orlandeau.{Newline}
{Newline}
Show leniency now, and they will only strike{Newline}
the harder. This fight is not only for ourselves,{Newline}
but for our people in equal measure.{Newline}
The Crown cumbers them with its every act.{Newline}
We fight to free them of such tyrannies.
{MClose}
{Color 08}Viscount Blanche{Newline}
{Color 00}His Grace has the right of it. Besides, why lay{Newline}
down the sword with victory so near?{Newline}
Your title is ill earned, "Thunder God" Cid.{Newline}
Your gentle words would sooner stir a breeze.
{MClose}
{Color 08}Count Cidolfus Orlandeau{Newline}
{Color 00}Is victory so near? My ears are deaf to{Newline}

What see you in our plight that portends{Newline}
victory? Or have you forsworn the use{Newline}
of your eyes?
{MClose}
{Color 08}Viscount Blanche{Newline}
{Color 00}I will not sit here and tolerate such insults!
{MClose}
{Color 08}Duke Goltanna{Newline}
{Color 00}Enough of this!{Newline}

You disappoint me, Orlandeau.{Newline}
Pray you do not disappoint me{Newline}
further.
{MClose}
{Color 08}Count Cidolfus Orlandeau{Newline}
{Color 00}...
{MClose}
{Color 08}Duke Goltanna{Newline}
{Color 00}I will say this but once.{Newline}

Father, what is this monstrosity?

I'm not entirely sure. I've been assembling it{Newline}
from pieces recovered in Tunnel 83.
{MClose}

It has the look of an orrery.

{MClose}
This device reacts to auracite as well?
{MClose}
Hmm—what's this? There's a mark{Newline}
inscribed upon the base. (♋){Newline}

A device for teleportation across{Newline}

Then, the man before us hails from{Newline}
a world beyond our own?
{MClose}
Like as not. Behold his manner{Newline}
of dress.
{MClose}
My name is...Cloud.{Newline}
Yes, that was it.
{MClose}
I am {Ramza}, of House Beoulve.{Newline}
That man over there is—

{Color 08}Cloud{Color 00}{Newline}
I couldn't care less what your names are.{Newline}

You surprise me, {Ramza}.{Newline}
I did not think to see you in Lesalia.{Newline}
{Newline}
Alma is here, you know. I'm sure{Newline}
she'd be delighted to see you.
{MClose}
{Color 08}{Ramza}{Newline}
{Color 00}Zalbaag...I—
{MClose}
Yes?
{MClose}
Can you not end this fighting?
{MClose}
What nonsense is this?
{MClose}
What purpose can it serve?{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
We Beoulves have ever fought to defend the{Newline}
people—not simply the Crown.{Newline}
{Newline}
And now we fight for no more than our own{Newline}
glory.
{MClose}
You speak of things you do not{Newline}
understand, {Ramza}!
{MClose}
It is you who do not understand, Brother!{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
All of this, this...war, has been plotted to some{Newline}
unseen purpose, Dukes Larg and Goltanna only{Newline}
puppets in some shadow play.
{MClose}
A shadow play? Pray tell how it ends.
{MClose}
I...I do not know.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
Our lord brother planned the princess's{Newline}
abduction to prevent Duke Goltanna from{Newline}
becoming regent.{Newline}
But someone intervened. Princess Ovelia{Newline}
lives, and is now in Goltanna's care.{Newline}
{Newline}
Had the assassination succeeded, the Crown{Newline}
would surely have named Duke Goltanna a{Newline}
traitor and rallied its banners against him.
{MClose}
Do you stand here accusing our brother {Newline}
of having some hand in this business with{Newline}
the princess?{Newline}
You think a man of your own blood capable{Newline}
of such a thing?
{MClose}
So you knew naught of this,{Newline}
Zalbaag?
{MClose}
Enough!{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
Who have you become, that you{Newline}
do not trust your own family?{Newline}
{Newline}
Begone from my sight! Return to{Newline}
Eagrose and trouble me no more!
{MClose}
You speak of trust, Zalbaag, yet{Newline}
you show me none in kind!
{MClose}
What have you ever done to inspire{Newline}
my trust?{Newline}
{Newline}
The mistake was my own. Until today{Newline}
I had looked on you as a true brother.{Newline}
{Newline}
But your mother's common blood{Newline}
forever stains you common. You are{Newline}
not fit to bear the Beoulve name!
{MClose}
You cannot mean that.

I come to bring you before the Office on{Newline}

{MClose}
I...I've never been good at good-byes.
{MClose}
You won't be coming back, will you.
{MClose}
Delita lives, Alma.
{MClose}
What? But how?
{MClose}
He helped them kidnap the princess.
{MClose}
Helped who?
{MClose}
At first I thought it Duke Goltanna—that{Newline}
Delita had sided with him to spite us.{Newline}
{Newline}
But now I fear he may be working with{Newline}
people far more dangerous still.{Newline}
{Newline}
It is they who wanted to thwart the plot{Newline}
to assassinate Princess Ovelia.
{MClose}
Is it true that Dycedarg{Newline}
planned her abduction?
{MClose}
It is.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
I am sure he had his reasons, but{Newline}
I cannot see them for the blood.
{MClose}
Then Tietra—?
{MClose}
—did not share her brother's luck.
{MClose}
Listen to me, Alma.{Newline}

{Newline}
I know not who guides Delita's actions,{Newline}
only that they are to be feared.{Newline}
{Newline}
I know not what evil lies at the end of{Newline}

And Delita serves these people?

I cannot be sure.{Newline}

{Color 08}Alma{Newline}
{Color 00}{Ramza}, you're all right!
{MClose}
{Color 08}{Ramza}{Newline}
{Color 00}As are you. I'm glad.{Newline}
{Newline}
*sigh* None of this makes sense.{Newline}
How could the Office of Inquisition{Newline}
have learned of the auracite?{Newline}
Could the Church of Glabados be{Newline}
the ones supporting Delita?{Newline}
{Newline}
What do they hope to gain?
{MClose}
{Ramza}? You mentioned{Newline}
auracite. Have you truly seen{Newline}
the Stones from the legend?{Newline}
If auracite is real, then—I think{Newline}
I may have seen it once, too.
{MClose}
What? Where!?
{MClose}
First you have to promise that{Newline}
you'll take me with you!
{MClose}
You persist in this? Do you think I would{Newline}
risk putting you in such peril again?{Newline}
{Newline}
I will not take you with me!
{MClose}
Then I have nothing more to say.
{MClose}
Do not act the child!{Newline}
Your very life is in danger!
{MClose}
I should think it is. I've acted against the{Newline}
Office of Inquisition.{Newline}
{Newline}
Surely I am a heretic in their eyes. They will{Newline}
come for me as they do you.{Newline}
{Newline}
And when they do, do you think Dycedarg{Newline}
will protect me? He would never do anything{Newline}
that might endanger House Beoulve.
{MClose}
No, I'm sure our dear brother would not.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
But you cannot come with me. The danger{Newline}
is too great!{Newline}
{Newline}
You must explain everything to Zalbaag and{Newline}
beg the forgiveness of the Church.
{MClose}
The one I saw—it was in Orbonne.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
A crystal, engraved with the likeness of{Newline}
a virgin maid.
{MClose}
Virgo...{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
I must reach it before they do.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
Thank you, Alma. Now go to Zalbaag, and{Newline}
do as I have said.
{MClose}
And just how do you think{Newline}
to enter the monastery?{Newline}
{Newline}
You're a heretic, remember?{Newline}
Do you think you will be{Newline}
welcome at Orbonne?
{MClose}
Ah...
{MClose}
So, you need me after all.
{MClose}
Fine, but only until we reach Orbonne.{Newline}
When it is done, you will come home.
{MClose}
I promise.
{MClose}
I will hold you to it.

{Color 00}Elder Simon!
{MClose}
Elder, speak to me!
{MClose}
{Color 08}Elder Simon{Newline}
{Color 00}Uhhn... Lady Alma...? What...what are{Newline}
you doing here?
{MClose}
Never mind that.{Newline}
What happened here?
{MClose}
You...you must leave this place at{Newline}
once, child. It is not safe.{Newline}
{Newline}
Men have come...come seeking the{Newline}
Stone.
{MClose}
{Color 08}{Ramza}{Newline}
{Color 00}A Zodiac Stone? Then it is as{Newline}
Alma said!
{MClose}
The Virgo Stone is one of...one of{Newline}
the crown jewels of Ivalice.{Newline}
{Newline}
It was given into our keeping when{Newline}
Lady Ovelia was brought here for her{Newline}
fosterage...as proof of her royalty.
{MClose}
And the ones come to take it—who{Newline}
are they?
{MClose}
You are...Alma's elder brother?{Newline}
{Ramza}, was it not?{Newline}
{Newline}
I beg you, my son—leave them be.{Newline}
Block their way, and they will only{Newline}
cut you down.
{MClose}
{Color 08}Man's Voice{Newline}
{Color 00}Where's the bloody Stone!?
{MClose}
{Color 08}Second Man's Voice{Newline}
{Color 00}Patience! It's here somewhere.{Newline}
We need only look harder!
{MClose}
{Color 08}Third Man's Voice{Newline}
{Color 00}Come, this leads to the lower vaults!
{MClose}
I am branded a heretic and hunted by{Newline}
the Church.{Newline}
{Newline}
Am I to assume the Stones I now{Newline}
possess are the reason? Who are{Newline}
these men? Please, I must know!
{MClose}
...Very well. High Confessor Marcel and{Newline}
his followers seek to restore the Church{Newline}
to prominence.{Newline}
As a first step, they have set Dukes Larg{Newline}
and Goltanna against one another to{Newline}
whittle down their military might.{Newline}
The longer the fighting lasts, the weaker{Newline}
the dukes become—and the more the{Newline}
people lose their faith in the Crown.
{MClose}
And by gathering these Stones, and{Newline}
reviving the Zodiac Braves? What do{Newline}
they hope to gain from such a show?
{MClose}
The support of the people, of course.
{MClose}
Truly? The cardinal used his Stone{Newline}
to infuse himself with the strength{Newline}
of the Lucavi.{Newline}
If such is the power of the Zodiac{Newline}
Stones, it is a power to rival that of{Newline}
any army.{Newline}
Is that strength not what the High{Newline}
Confessor seeks?
{MClose}
You are unlike your brothers. You remind{Newline}
me a great deal more of your late lord{Newline}
father.{Newline}
You—you may well have what is needed{Newline}
to put a stop to their ambitions.
{MClose}
Wait here. I am going after them.
{MClose}
And I with you!
{MClose}
We cannot leave Elder Simon here alone.{Newline}
Find a safe place to hide. Wait there with{Newline}
him until I return!
{MClose}
Very well.
{MClose}
I shall leave the auracite with you,{Newline}
lest the worst befall me.{Newline}
{Newline}
If I fail to return, cast it into the{Newline}
Bugross Sea.
{MClose}
It pains me that I can do no more{Newline}
at times like this.{Newline}
{Newline}
How I wish I'd been born a man{Newline}
like you.
{MClose}
Don't be ridiculous! Who would I ever{Newline}
turn to if I didn't have my little sister?
{MClose}
{Ramza}...
{MClose}
Take Elder Simon to safety!

Change does not come without cost!{Newline}
Revolution requires martyrs, and we{Newline}

The Crown is rotten, the nobility corrupt.{Newline}

when a man is made a demon.{Newline}

What nonsense is that? The only demon{Newline}
I see stands before me!{Newline}
{Newline}
Was it not you who murdered the{Newline}
cardinal for the Stone he possessed?{Newline}

Not that he would have long lived{Newline}

{Color 08}Isilud{Newline}
{Color 00}I will not be bested by this heretic!{Newline}
{Newline}
But nor will I risk death for honor here.{Newline}

{Color 00}I...I had to bring you this.
{MClose}
A book?
{MClose}
Written by a man named Germonique...one of{Newline}
Saint Ajora's disciples.{Newline}
{Newline}
It was lost for a great many years. Only{Newline}
recently did I discover it among the stacks{Newline}
of our reliquary beneath the monastery.{Newline}
It chronicles the true tale of the Zodiac{Newline}
Braves—no detail is omitted.

Please, Elder, you'll tire yourself.

{Color 08}{Ramza}{Newline}
{Color 00}Father... What would you have done?
{MClose}
Is that...?
{MClose}
{Color 08}Orran{Newline}
{Color 00}We meet again.
{MClose}
I see the Black Lion sits upon your{Newline}
breast. You are of the Order of the{Newline}
Southern Sky, then?
{MClose}
I am. And it would seem we have you{Newline}
to thank for dealing with our deserters.{Newline}
{Newline}
Ha! I must admit, I'd never thought{Newline}
I'd see the day a Beoulve lent his aid{Newline}
to -our- order!
{MClose}
The fight was not of my choosing.
{MClose}
I know. You do not wish to shed blood,{Newline}
but it cannot always be avoided.{Newline}
{Newline}
We're no different. Do you think we hunt{Newline}
these men down out of enmity? Craven{Newline}
they may be, but they've not wronged us.
{MClose}
You knew who I was all along, didn't you?
{MClose}
I did. I'd seen your name and face upon{Newline}
a bill.{Newline}
{Newline}
Inexpiable heresy, was it not? My mind{Newline}
reels at the thought of what you must{Newline}
have done!
{MClose}
Have you a mind to turn me in?
{MClose}
Why would I do that?{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
Our orders are to capture deserters.{Newline}
They say nothing of heretics already{Newline}
hunted mercilessly by their own.{Newline}
If I were one of those, I think I'd get{Newline}
moving before the lions at my heels{Newline}
thought to feast upon me as well.
{MClose}
Why do you still fight?
{MClose}
So long as your brothers point their{Newline}
swords at our throats, we must.
{MClose}
If the White Lion lowered his claws,{Newline}
the Black would follow suit?
{MClose}
No, I do not think it like he would.
{MClose}
Could you deliver a message to Count{Newline}
Orlandeau, if you should chance to{Newline}
meet him?{Newline}
There are men behind the curtain who{Newline}
goad the dukes for their own gain.{Newline}
{Newline}
We are all but puppets, dancing as they{Newline}
pull our strings. It is those men we{Newline}
ought be fighting.
{MClose}
I can deliver the message. But why to the{Newline}
count?
{MClose}
My father once told me Count Orlandeau{Newline}
was the only man he could truly call friend.
{MClose}
I am the count's adopted son. I will tell him{Newline}
what you've told me.
{MClose}
Then you believe me?
{MClose}
I do not know the reason these men seek{Newline}
the Zodiac Stones.{Newline}
{Newline}
If it is for the benefit of the people, I see{Newline}
no reason to raise protest.{Newline}
{Newline}
But if they seek to use the legend for{Newline}
their own gain, I can assure you my{Newline}
stepfather will not sit idly by.{Newline}
It was not for quiet complacence he was{Newline}
given the name of "Thunder God."
{MClose}
You know of the High Confessor's plot?
{MClose}
Of it, yes. But we have no hard evidence.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
Our spies are working tirelessly, but I{Newline}
suspect you know more than they.
{MClose}
If you did have evidence of the plot,{Newline}
would you then be willing to lay down{Newline}
your swords?
{MClose}
Such evidence exists?
{MClose}
The Scriptures—no, it matters not.{Newline}
I simply wish to know.
{MClose}
Whether or not it would mean the end of{Newline}
this conflict, I cannot say.{Newline}
{Newline}
But my father, for one, would surely{Newline}
sheathe his blade.
{MClose}
{Color 08}Southern Sky Knight{Newline}
{Color 00}Lord Orran! We must press onward!
{MClose}
Very well. Let us resume our march!
{MClose}
Farewell, {Ramza}. See that{Newline}
you keep your head about your{Newline}
shoulders.
{MClose}
Never think yourself without allies!{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
You -do- have friends—friends who{Newline}
would gladly lay down their lives{Newline}
fighting beside you!{Newline}
And I count myself among them!
{MClose}
Thank you, Orran.

{Color 00}Are you blind to the treason of your{Newline}
words, Rapha!?
{MClose}
{Color 08}Rapha{Newline}
{Color 00}Me? It is you who cannot see!{Newline}
{Newline}
He uses us, Marach! We are instruments{Newline}
of murder to him, naught more!{Newline}
{Newline}
To stay would be to live out our days{Newline}
as the grand duke's cat's-paws, killing{Newline}
so he might keep his own hands clean!{Newline}
Come, let us run away together while{Newline}
we yet can!
{MClose}
{Color 08}Marach{Newline}
{Color 00}Have you forgotten who it was who saved us{Newline}
when we had lost our parents to the war?{Newline}
Grand Duke Barrington opened his heart and{Newline}
home to the both of us. You would repay{Newline}
that kindness now with treachery?{Newline}
We owe him a debt of allegiance. We'd have{Newline}
died a beggar's death were it not for him!
{MClose}
Feed us he did, Marach, but we were supped{Newline}
on lies!{Newline}
{Newline}
I know the truth of it now. It was the grand{Newline}
duke himself who set fire to our village, his{Newline}
hand hidden by the smoke of war!{Newline}
And do you know why—why he killed everyone{Newline}
we ever knew? It was for our gifts! You and I{Newline}
possess power, and power is all he craves.{Newline}
He burnt down our entire village that he might{Newline}
claim the sacred power of our mantras for his{Newline}
own!{Newline}
Opened his heart, you say? The man is not{Newline}
possessed of one! It is -you- who need open{Newline}
your -eyes-, Marach!
{MClose}
I'll not abide your ill-mannered tongue!
{MClose}

{Color 00}Pay my sister no heed! I will put{Newline}
an end to her defiance!{Newline}
The only slaying you need concern{Newline}
yourself with is {Ramza}'s!{Newline}
Leave Rapha to me.
{MClose}
But how will you explain her death{Newline}
to Grand Duke Barrington?
{MClose}
Did I not just tell you that is none{Newline}

{Color 08}Rapha{Newline}
{Color 00}Grand Duke Barrington has eyes for one thing:{Newline}
the throne of Ivalice.{Newline}
They call him King already—King of the Forge.{Newline}
He fashions ever more and stronger arms, and{Newline}
trains mages enough for all the realm.
{MClose}
{Color 08}{Ramza}{Newline}
{Color 00}His actions are guided from the shadows.{Newline}
{Newline}
There are others—men who promise to{Newline}
eliminate the dukes Larg and Goltanna,{Newline}
and dub the grand duke regent.
{MClose}
And you fight these men, when fighting them{Newline}
means you must be labeled a heretic? Why{Newline}
would you do such a thing?{Newline}
No, that is a silly question. I know the answer.{Newline}
But surely you must realize your efforts will{Newline}
earn you no thanks.
{MClose}
I do not fight for gratitude.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
I am a Beoulve. I fight for the honor{Newline}
of my name.
{MClose}
I'd not believe that for a moment. You strike{Newline}
me not as the sort of man to fight for things{Newline}
so trite.{Newline}
No, you see evil and injustice before your{Newline}
eyes and cannot turn away. You do not even{Newline}
think to seek reward.
{MClose}
You mistake me for a better man.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
But we have spoken enough of me.{Newline}
What will you do now? I must make for {Newline}
Riovanes. They hold my sister there.{Newline}
What of you, now that you've escaped? 
{MClose}
I cannot leave. Not without my brother.
{MClose}
There's a quarrel between the two of{Newline}
you, is there not?
{MClose}
He refuses to accept the truth. We were{Newline}
orphaned in the war, you see. We lost our{Newline}
parents, our home—all but our lives.{Newline}
The memories haunt me even now. Climbing{Newline}
mounds of rubble in search of any scrap of food,{Newline}
the air ever thick with death's foul stench...{Newline}
That was the life from which the grand duke{Newline}
spared us. At the time, I thought it sure the{Newline}
gods had sent him.
{MClose}
You were not alone. He erected a great many{Newline}
orphanages in the war's wake. It was a noble{Newline}
gesture of less than noble intent.{Newline}
He wanted assassins. The orphanages gave him{Newline}
a pool of willing young minds, allowing him to{Newline}
select the very best to groom and train.{Newline}
He must have seen some promise in you and{Newline}
your brother.
{MClose}
We Galthenas are the keepers of a sacred{Newline}
art, passed down through the generations.{Newline}
{Newline}
My brother and I are conduits, I of the{Newline}
heavens and he of the nether. We channel{Newline}
their power through mantra.{Newline}
Grand Duke Barrington desired that power{Newline}
for his own. When our elder refused him, the{Newline}
grand duke put our entire village to the torch.{Newline}
All is grist that comes to that man's mill.{Newline}
If there is a thing he cannot have, he thinks{Newline}
it better that it not exist at all.{Newline}
To imagine the joy he must have felt when{Newline}
he discovered the two of us among the other{Newline}
orphans—it turns my stomach.
{MClose}
So when you learned of all this, you tried{Newline}
to flee...
{MClose}
My brother and I loved the man as{Newline}
though he were our father.{Newline}
{Newline}
But even that did not stop him{Newline}
from...from—!
{MClose}
For a man of his high station to so{Newline}
prey upon the weak—it is not meet.
{MClose}
{Color 08}Marach's Voice{Newline}
{Color 00}I would have thought you fled{Newline}
farther.
{MClose}
Marach!
{MClose}
Heed my words, heretic! Spare{Newline}
no haste on your way to Riovanes!{Newline}
{Newline}

{Color 08}Grand Duke Barrington{Newline}
{Color 00}Ah, a warmest welcome to you both. I do hope{Newline}
you've found my halls to your pleasure.{Newline}
They may lack the grandeur of Lesalia's, but{Newline}
I find they make up for it in other ways.{Newline}
{Newline}
Castles built as seats of governance are so{Newline}
dreadfully plain. Would you not agree?{Newline}
{Newline}
There is such greater beauty in a fortress{Newline}
built for war.{Newline}
{Newline}
Ivalice herself would seem to be in agreement.{Newline}
Ever has she been ruled by men with power.{Newline}
{Newline}
Some might take this latest upheaval as a{Newline}
sign that the Crown—in its austere seat—{Newline}
has lost the strength to keep her under rein.
{MClose}
{Color 08}Folmarv{Newline}
{Color 00}Your summons spoke of matters more{Newline}
pressing than the style of Lesalia's keep.
{MClose}
Must everyone be in such haste?
{MClose}
Very well, I shall ask you outright.{Newline}
Will you not join your strength with{Newline}
mine?
{MClose}
I am afraid your meaning escapes{Newline}
me, Your Grace.
{MClose}
As I said a moment ago, it is -power- that{Newline}
rules Ivalice.{Newline}
{Newline}
Who do you think now holds power? Duke{Newline}
Larg, and the Order of the Northern Sky?{Newline}
{Newline}
Duke Goltanna, mayhap, with the Southern{Newline}
Sky's swords at his beck and call?{Newline}
{Newline}
No, I can assure you it is not they. The ones{Newline}
who hold true power are the ones who hold{Newline}
the Zodiac Stones—the Knights Templar.
{MClose}
You think us the greatest power{Newline}
in Ivalice?
{MClose}
The Stones are said to possess{Newline}
phenomenal magick.{Newline}
{Newline}
If legend is to be believed, they were{Newline}
responsible for the cataclysm that laid{Newline}
waste to Mullonde in bygone days.
{MClose}
Ah ha ha! Oh, forgive me. I forget{Newline}
myself.{Newline}
{Newline}
It's just—I would never have expected{Newline}
a man like yourself to believe in such{Newline}
utter fantasy.
{MClose}
You mean to tell me that you do not?{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
Curious. I had heard that the cardinal's{Newline}
death was somehow connected to the{Newline}
Stones.
{MClose}
Truly? As I had it, the cardinal had{Newline}
taken ill.
{MClose}
Is that so? Might I ask, then, the reason{Newline}
you seek that young Beoulve?{Newline}
{Newline}
I can only imagine what he must have{Newline}
done to earn the label of heretic.
{MClose}
The inquisitors do not share with us{Newline}
the reasons for their decisions.
{MClose}
So, you know nothing at all.{Newline}
How terribly convenient!{Newline}
{Newline}
Still, I wonder if there could not{Newline}
be some detail you are simply{Newline}
forgetting.{Newline}
Marach!
{MClose}
{Color 08}Isilud{Newline}
{Color 00}Father... F-forgive me.
{MClose}
Hmph. Your meaning becomes{Newline}
clearer.
{MClose}
I've taken Scorpio and Taurus{Newline}
for safekeeping.
{MClose}
You worthless fool of a son!
{MClose}
{Color 08}Riovanesian Guard{Newline}
{Color 00}Pardon my intrusion, Your Grace, but{Newline}
your long-awaited guests are at our gate.
{MClose}
Marach, would you kindly see{Newline}
to them?
{MClose}
What is it you wish, Barrington?
{MClose}
Cooperation. I said as much a few moments{Newline}
ago. It would be a mutually beneficial{Newline}
arrangement, I assure you.
{MClose}
And if we were to refuse?
{MClose}
Then I suppose I'd be forced to unmask the{Newline}
Church's plot for what it is.
{MClose}
Stones alone prove naught.
{MClose}
In that you are correct, ser.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
But it would be hard to say the same of the{Newline}
Scriptures of Germonique.{Newline}
{Newline}
I dare contend they might generate something{Newline}
more of a stir. Duke Larg, Duke Goltanna—{Newline}
even the Council is like to raise an eye at those.
{MClose}
Where are they?
{MClose}
Oh, who could say? You of all{Newline}
people must know how easily such{Newline}
details can elude the mind's grasp.
{MClose}
Wiegraf, see to the mage who{Newline}
left a moment ago. I shall attend{Newline}
to matters here.
{MClose}
Do not think to threaten me! This is{Newline}
a battle you cannot hope to win.
{MClose}
No, it is one we cannot hope to{Newline}
lose.{Newline}
{Newline}
Who is there to oppose us, save{Newline}
you feeble-bodied humans?
{MClose}
Father...?
{MClose}
You misjudge the strength of your{Newline}
enemy, Grand Duke Barrington.{Newline}
There will be no sport in killing you.
{MClose}
You would raise arms against{Newline}
your host under his own roof!?

{Color 00}So, you've come.
{MClose}
Draw your sword, {Ramza}.
{MClose}
Not in the mood? I hope you will{Newline}
not object to me drawing mine.
{MClose}
I pity you, Wiegraf. More than you can know.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
What must Milleuda think, to see you now?{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
You would sell your soul to the Lucavi to{Newline}
slake your thirst for revenge.
{MClose}
Revenge? You think that is what{Newline}
drives me?{Newline}
{Newline}
I have no such petty concerns.{Newline}
I do not fight to avenge Milleuda's {Newline}
death.{Newline}
I sow the seeds of chaos in the{Newline}
world of men, and reap the{Newline}
anguished cries of the weak.{Newline}
But worry not, {Ramza}.{Newline}
Yours is a special case.{Newline}
I shall kill -you- myself!
{MClose}
{Color 08}{Ramza}{Newline}
{Color 00}Auracite is the work of demons, not gods—{Newline}
the Zodiac Braves, their unholy knights.{Newline}

{MClose}
*chuckle* All such tales of gods and their{Newline}
miracles are false.{Newline}
{Newline}
Those who would lead prefer that history suit{Newline}
their needs, and rewrite it to see that it does.{Newline}
{Newline}
And why shouldn't they? The fault lies not with{Newline}
them.{Newline}
{Newline}
The reeking masses yearn for gods and miracles.{Newline}
It is their opiate, and they consume it greedily.{Newline}
{Newline}
The people do not endeavor towards greatness,{Newline}
but rather mire themselves in their petty{Newline}
strifes—shackles on the feet of man.{Newline}
Their leaders give them no more than that for{Newline}
which they clamor. It is history's oldest and{Newline}
most oft-repeated tale.{Newline}
Do men exploit this weakness to dominate their{Newline}
fellows? Mayhap they do.{Newline}
{Newline}
But they succeed only because the people are{Newline}
eager to know such dominion.{Newline}
{Newline}
Gods are only illusions born of man's fear.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
It is they who see this charade for what it is{Newline}
and join in the pageantry who are to blame.
{MClose}
And you? You did not conquer your fear.{Newline}
You turned to the auracite to find your{Newline}
miracle.
{MClose}
It is -because- I am weak, -because-{Newline}
I fear, that I turn to the gods.{Newline}
{Newline}
Can you claim to be free of weakness{Newline}

No, but I endeavor to be so!

{Color 00}Truly, it is a joy that we should{Newline}
chance to meet again.{Newline}
I once suffered defeat at your hands,{Newline}
but it will not happen twice. This dead{Newline}
city will be your final resting place!
{MClose}
{Color 08}{Ramza}{Newline}
{Color 00}So you've become a pawn of{Newline}
the Lucavi, too.{Newline}
Was such your fear of death,{Newline}
that you would sooner bend{Newline}
your knee to demons?
{MClose}
{Color 08}Barich{Newline}
{Color 00}You are a naive child who speaks of{Newline}
things he does not understand.{Newline}
Only now am I made truly human!
{MClose}
How does selling your soul to{Newline}
demons make you human?
{MClose}
I stand above all other men now.{Newline}
I have transcended death itself!{Newline}
{Newline}
No longer must I bow my head in{Newline}
coy attempts to curry favor with{Newline}
you highborn nobles!{Newline}
I've bought my freedom. I am a{Newline}
human at last—no longer something{Newline}
less!
{MClose}
You think freedom a thing bought and{Newline}
sold?{Newline}
{Newline}
What value, a freedom you have not{Newline}
earned?{Newline}
{Newline}
A man who's lost his pride can never be{Newline}
free.{Newline}
{Newline}
You surrendered your own freedom the{Newline}
moment you bowed your head to someone{Newline}
undeserving!{Newline}
Freedom and equality cannot be bartered.{Newline}
They are rights—rights earned with{Newline}
sweat, and toil, and blood!{Newline}
Freedom is no raiment of Lucavi weave!{Newline}
They tell you you wear cloth of gold, but{Newline}
in truth you stand more naked as before!

does Virgo not awaken?

The spirit of the High Seraph lingers in this{Newline}

{Newline}
What could be amiss?

Mayhap you are not the vessel of Saint{Newline}
Ajora after all.{Newline}

No. No, it cannot be that. Virgo stirred{Newline}

They have come.

Yet still she covets more.{Newline}
So be it. Once more to world of light,{Newline}

{Color 00}I have not seen such slaughter.{Newline}
There are corpses at every turn.
{MClose}
{Color 08}Rapha{Newline}
{Color 00}But your sister was not among them, was she?
{MClose}
{Color 08}{Ramza}{Newline}
{Color 00}No, she's not here.
{MClose}
They had her in the castle, I'm sure of it.{Newline}
They must have taken her elsewhere during{Newline}
the fighting.{Newline}
Three men from the templarate arrived not{Newline}
long before you. Three and no more.
{MClose}
One became a Lucavi. I killed him myself.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
Another, Isilud, was slain in the melee.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
This third must have taken Alma.
{MClose}
No doubt he means to bring her to Mullonde.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
Mullonde is the seat of the Church's power,{Newline}
and they act in High Confessor Marcel's name.{Newline}
{Newline}
Where else would he go?
{MClose}
I wonder.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
I do not think their High Confessor knows{Newline}
the true power of the Stones.{Newline}
{Newline}
Consider this. Wiegraf did not know their secret{Newline}
until he had struck his bargain with Belias.{Newline}
{Newline}
And by the look of things, Isilud died fighting{Newline}
the Lucavi.
{MClose}
What are you getting at?
{MClose}
By inciting this war, the Church hopes to{Newline}
broaden its power.{Newline}
{Newline}
Clearly this is the High Confessor's ambition.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
But he only wants the Zodiac Stones for their{Newline}
symbolic power. To sway the minds of the{Newline}
people.
{MClose}
Do you imply that someone is using the High{Newline}
Confessor's ambition to some other purpose?
{MClose}
This third man in the templarate's party.{Newline}
Who is he?
{MClose}
I cannot say for sure, but I believe it was{Newline}
Lord Folmarv, commander of the Knights{Newline}
Templar.
{MClose}
He is the key.
{MClose}
What will you do?
{MClose}
I travel to Zeltennia. Delita is there, and I{Newline}
must see him.
{MClose}
He succeeded Baron Grimms in leading the{Newline}
Blackram Knights, did he not?
{MClose}
The Church and the Knights Templar manipulate{Newline}
Delita from behind the scenes.{Newline}
{Newline}
With luck, he can shed some light on who this{Newline}
Lord Folmarv is, and what he wants.

The Knights Templar, too, are passing busy,{Newline}

If only we had some evidence of the High{Newline}

And then the storm will be upon us.

{Color 08}{Ramza}{Newline}
{Color 00}Two errands brought me to Zeltennia.{Newline}
The first was to meet with you.{Newline}
The second is to speak with Count{Newline}
Orlandeau.
{MClose}
The Thunder God?
{MClose}
I mean to enlist his aid in exposing{Newline}
the Church's intrigues.
{MClose}
How?
{MClose}
I have powerful evidence of the{Newline}
Church's misdeeds.
{MClose}
The Scriptures of Germonique!
{MClose}
I spoke with the count's adopted{Newline}
son, Orran, not long past.{Newline}
{Newline}
He pledged their aid should I bring{Newline}
hard evidence against the Church.
{MClose}
Orran, eh?
{MClose}
It's all right. She's with me.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
Mullonde has provided several others to help{Newline}
me carry out my task. She is but one.
{MClose}
Help you? I was sent to keep{Newline}
-watch- on you.
{MClose}
And a fine job you're doing of it.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
Only she knows our plans in full. I trust no{Newline}
other in Goltanna's army more.
{MClose}
You're the youngest Beoulve,{Newline}
{Ramza}, am I right?{Newline}
{Newline}
My name is Valmafra.
{MClose}
I take it you did not come for idle chat?
{MClose}
{Color 08}Valmafra{Newline}
{Color 00}The Northern Order moves.
{MClose}
They make for Besselat?
{MClose}
Count Orlandeau himself has departed for{Newline}
the same only just now.{Newline}
{Newline}
Duke Goltanna is like to join them soon. At{Newline}
the head of your Blackram Knights, no less.
{MClose}
Then we're too late. The fighting will continue.
{MClose}
Do not give up yet.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
I might still convince the count to avoid this{Newline}
needless bloodshed.
{MClose}
Then our paths part once again.
{MClose}
Be safe, Delita.
{MClose}
And you, {Ramza}.
{MClose}
You mean to let him go?
{MClose}
He acts as I expected he would.
{MClose}
Even your friends are only pieces to be played.
{MClose}
Mind your words! You know not what{Newline}
you say!
{MClose}
Such outbursts ill become a man.
{MClose}
Haven't you somewhere else to be?

{Color 08}Knight Templar Barich{Newline}
{Color 00}That's the last of it. The winds bear{Newline}
it onward now.{Newline}
And fair winds they are. They should{Newline}
keep it airborne for a half-day if they{Newline}
hold—more than time enough.
{MClose}
Now there is a creature I had not{Newline}
thought to find in these wastes!
{MClose}
One might say the same of a Knight{Newline}
Templar so far from the Church.{Newline}
{Newline}
What is it you scatter to the wind?
{MClose}
Oh, that?{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
I suppose there's no harm in your{Newline}
knowing. There's naught you can{Newline}
do to stop it now.
{MClose}
Stop what!?
{MClose}
This.
{MClose}
Poison!
{MClose}
Yes. Ground into a fine powder and cast{Newline}
upon the winds toward the Northern Sky.{Newline}
{Newline}
The toxin will not kill the men who breathe{Newline}
it—but it will wither their constitution,{Newline}
rendering them unable to fight.
{MClose}
But why? The High Confessor stands{Newline}
to gain naught by handing victory to{Newline}
Goltanna!
{MClose}
Nor does he think to.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
The moment Goltanna hears of the{Newline}
Northern Order's plight, he will send his{Newline}
armies against them.{Newline}
With his own stronghold unguarded, Goltanna{Newline}
will be an easy target for assassination, and{Newline}
Count Orlandeau with him.{Newline}
But do not think Duke Larg will escape this{Newline}
scourge—his is the easy death to achieve.{Newline}
{Newline}
Amidst the coming chaos, who could say{Newline}
how Duke Larg might meet his end?{Newline}
{MClose}
You're inhuman!
{MClose}
You ought rejoice! This will mean{Newline}
an end to war and bloodshed.{Newline}
{Newline}
And with that end, a new beginning.{Newline}
The Church's hand shall rule. Such{Newline}
is the will of the people.{Newline}
They clamor for change—an end to{Newline}
groveling at highborn heels.
{MClose}
The war will end, but not like this.{Newline}
There is another way!
{MClose}
I expected you'd say as much—no matter!
{MClose}
{Color 08}Barich{Newline}
{Color 00}Once you've put a stop to this{Newline}
fighting, what then?{Newline}
How do you propose to purge{Newline}
Ivalice of her corruption?{Newline}
{Newline}
Her fever will not cease to rage till{Newline}
her festered limbs are cut and seared!{Newline}
Even you must see that now!
{MClose}
{Color 08}{Ramza}{Newline}
{Color 00}You would cut away the pure flesh with{Newline}
the foul.{Newline}
There is corruption, yes, but there are{Newline}
also good men in Ivalice, and they are{Newline}
not few!{Newline}
There are ways to heal a festered{Newline}
wound without the knife. The poison{Newline}
can be drawn!
{MClose}
Pray tell what poultice might draw{Newline}
the nobles from this land!{Newline}
{Newline}
So long as you blight it with your{Newline}
existence, we must bow to your{Newline}
whims.{Newline}
A man alone might know equality.{Newline}
Two men, never! One will ever seek{Newline}
to exploit the other.{Newline}
And I will not be exploited! I will{Newline}
claim your seat, and take what is{Newline}
my due.{Newline}
I should think I have at least that right!
{MClose}
You think to cure the realm's corruption{Newline}
by becoming part of it?{Newline}
{Newline}
What when another comes to claim your{Newline}
seat? You care not for Ivalice's suffering—{Newline}
you care only for your own!
{MClose}
Such righteous words! More the{Newline}
greater your hypocrisy!
{MClose}
{Color 08}Barich{Newline}
{Color 00}No! I was not...not{Newline}
to die like this...

{Color 08}Knight Templar Barich{Newline}
{Color 00}That's the last of it. The winds bear{Newline}
it onward now.{Newline}
And fair winds they are. They should{Newline}
keep it airborne for a half-day if they{Newline}
hold—more than time enough.
{MClose}
Now there is a creature I had not{Newline}
thought to find in these wastes!
{MClose}
One might say the same of a Knight{Newline}
Templar so far from the Church.{Newline}
{Newline}
What is it you scatter to the wind?
{MClose}
Oh, that?{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
I suppose there's no harm in your{Newline}
knowing. There's naught you can{Newline}
do to stop it now.
{MClose}
Stop what!?
{MClose}
This.
{MClose}
Poison!
{MClose}
Yes. Ground into a fine powder and cast{Newline}
upon the winds toward the Northern Sky.{Newline}
{Newline}
The toxin will not kill the men who breathe{Newline}
it—but it will wither their constitution,{Newline}
rendering them unable to fight.
{MClose}
But why? The High Confessor stands{Newline}
to gain naught by handing victory to{Newline}
Goltanna!
{MClose}
Nor does he think to.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
The moment Goltanna hears of the{Newline}
Northern Order's plight, he will send his{Newline}
armies against them.{Newline}
With his own stronghold unguarded, Goltanna{Newline}
will be an easy target for assassination, and{Newline}
Count Orlandeau with him.{Newline}
But do not think Duke Larg will escape this{Newline}
scourge—his is the easy death to achieve.{Newline}
{Newline}
Amidst the coming chaos, who could say{Newline}
how Duke Larg might meet his end?{Newline}
{MClose}
You're inhuman!
{MClose}
You ought rejoice! This will mean{Newline}
an end to war and bloodshed.{Newline}
{Newline}
And with that end, a new beginning.{Newline}
The Church's hand shall rule. Such{Newline}
is the will of the people.{Newline}
They clamor for change—an end to{Newline}
groveling at highborn heels.
{MClose}
The war will end, but not like this.{Newline}
There is another way!
{MClose}
I expected you'd say as much—no matter!
{MClose}
{Color 08}Barich{Newline}
{Color 00}Once you've put a stop to this{Newline}
fighting, what then?{Newline}
How do you propose to purge{Newline}
Ivalice of her corruption?{Newline}
{Newline}
Her fever will not cease to rage till{Newline}
her festered limbs are cut and seared!{Newline}
Even you must see that now!
{MClose}
{Color 08}{Ramza}{Newline}
{Color 00}You would cut away the pure flesh with{Newline}
the foul.{Newline}
There is corruption, yes, but there are{Newline}
also good men in Ivalice, and they are{Newline}
not few!{Newline}
There are ways to heal a festered{Newline}
wound without the knife. The poison{Newline}
can be drawn!
{MClose}
Pray tell what poultice might draw{Newline}
the nobles from this land!{Newline}
{Newline}
So long as you blight it with your{Newline}
existence, we must bow to your{Newline}
whims.{Newline}
A man alone might know equality.{Newline}
Two men, never! One will ever seek{Newline}
to exploit the other.{Newline}
And I will not be exploited! I will{Newline}
claim your seat, and take what is{Newline}
my due.{Newline}
I should think I have at least that right!
{MClose}
You think to cure the realm's corruption{Newline}
by becoming part of it?{Newline}
{Newline}
What when another comes to claim your{Newline}
seat? You care not for Ivalice's suffering—{Newline}
you care only for your own!
{MClose}
Such righteous words! More the{Newline}
greater your hypocrisy!
{MClose}
{Color 08}Barich{Newline}
{Color 00}No! I was not...not{Newline}
to die like this...
{MClose}
{Color 08}{Ramza}{Newline}
{Color 00}Gods give us haste.

{Color 00}Please, my lord. Do not make this harder{Newline}
than it must be. We have our orders.
{MClose}
Why in the name of all that's good{Newline}
would I wish to unseat my liege lord?
{MClose}
{Color 08}Duke Goltanna{Newline}
{Color 00}You ask the very question that vexes me.{Newline}
I am gravely disappointed in you, Cid.
{MClose}
Surely you cannot mean that,{Newline}
Your Grace! I am no turncloak!{Newline}
I am your most loyal man!
{MClose}
The proof speaks otherwise.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
It seems you have been in league with{Newline}
members of the Church, working secretly{Newline}
to see me ousted from my rightful seat.
{MClose}
That is absurd! From what lying{Newline}
blackguard did you hear such reverie!?
{MClose}
Even yet you deny it?{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
My information comes from the High{Newline}
Confessor himself. You can imagine{Newline}
his distress upon learning of the plot.
{MClose}
Your Grace, the High Confessor{Newline}
deceives you! It is he who schemes{Newline}
in the shadows!
{MClose}
The High Confessor? Now there is an{Newline}
august claim! Have you any evidence{Newline}
of this?
{MClose}
Twenty and more years of loyal service,{Newline}
and still you require evidence? Words{Newline}
fail me, Your Grace.
{MClose}
As you fail me. I cannot hope to fight a{Newline}
war without your Order's forces. Still,{Newline}
it seems I am left no choice.{Newline}
A lamentable situation for us both.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
Take him from my sight!
{MClose}
{Color 08}Delita{Newline}
{Color 00}You summoned, Your Grace?
{MClose}
I want you to maintain your contact{Newline}
with Mullonde.{Newline}
{Newline}
Once the Confessional rescript is in{Newline}
my hands, Larg is as good as defeated.
{MClose}
Fear not, Your Grace. The High{Newline}
Confessor's mind is most firm on{Newline}
that account.
{MClose}
Hmm. He had seemed somewhat{Newline}
indifferent to me.{Newline}
{Newline}
There is another matter as well.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
I am placing the Order of the Southern{Newline}
Sky under your leadership. Henceforth,{Newline}
you are a Knight Devout.
{MClose}
You grant me honor far beyond{Newline}
my due.
{MClose}
I expect I shall not regret it. I place{Newline}
my full and utter confidence in you,{Newline}
Delita—you, and you alone.
{MClose}
Your Grace.

Excellency, are you harmed?
{MClose}
Someone! Summon an apothecary at once!
{MClose}
How do you feel, Your Excellency?
{MClose}
My head...it is as though it were split in twain.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
But I do not think it serious. I just need...some{Newline}
time.
{MClose}
Most unfortunate.
{MClose}
What?
{MClose}
Urgh... What...have you done?
{MClose}
Dycedarg!?
{MClose}
Be silent, Brother!
{MClose}
You...you've betrayed me?{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
You killed your father to...to{Newline}
gain control of your house.{Newline}
{Newline}
And now you have killed me.
{MClose}
Is this poison your work as well?
{MClose}
No... No.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
It is a gift of those who would see House{Newline}
Beoulve take center stage.
{MClose}
Why do this?
{MClose}
Duke Larg was slain in battle. It is now left{Newline}
to House Beoulve to carry out his wishes.
{MClose}
This—you go too far.
{MClose}
This dagger. Place it among the corpses.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
They were assassins. Sent by the Southern{Newline}
Order.{Newline}
{Newline}
You understand me...yes?

And this must be {Ramza}.{Newline}
How you've grown, boy! Still,{Newline}

{Color 00}Have we met, Excellency?

Yes, though I can't say I'm surprised you've{Newline}

{Newline}
You were only a child of some three or four{Newline}
years at the time.{Newline}
{Newline}
You gave us all quite a fright, trying to lift my{Newline}
sword. Your father gave you a scolding that left{Newline}
you in tears, but at least you weren't hurt.{Newline}
Ha ha ha.
{MClose}
And now here you've come to rescue me.{Newline}
I thank you.{Newline}
{Newline}
There's no need to kneel.
{MClose}
The battle is ended, with only light casualties{Newline}
on either side. This, too, thanks to the help of{Newline}
{Ramza} and his companions.{Newline}
We've managed to hold the fires of war at bay,{Newline}
for a time.
{MClose}
I see. You are a worthy son of Barbaneth,{Newline}
young {Ramza}.{Newline}
{Newline}
There are many who owe you their thanks, and{Newline}
I give it now in their stead. And mine with it, to{Newline}
be sure.
{MClose}
I do only what must needs be done.
{MClose}
I see your likeness to Barbaneth is more than{Newline}
skin deep. Your deeds honor him, boy.

But Duke Goltanna means to execute Your{Newline}
Excellency on the morrow. We should waste{Newline}
no time in fleeing.
{MClose}
It is as she says, my lord.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
We should continue this elsewhere.
{MClose}
Yes, yes. It won't do for me to remain here{Newline}
with Goltanna in this ill temper.{Newline}
{Newline}
Orran, the hour of this war's end will not{Newline}
be long in coming. Until it does, I mean to{Newline}
travel with {Ramza}.{Newline}
We must put a stop to the High Confessor's{Newline}
plans.
{MClose}
Then I will go with you, my lord!
{MClose}
No. You will return to Zeltennia and see to{Newline}
the safety of Lady Ovelia.{Newline}
{Newline}
She alone is the rightful heir to the throne.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
You must see that she comes to no harm.
{MClose}
I understand.
{MClose}
Well, {Ramza}, you've no{Newline}
objections, I trust?
{MClose}
None at all, my lord.
{MClose}
Then let's away before we're found.

on your position.

{Color 00}Ivalice's reunification under its rightful king{Newline}
was His Grace's most fervent wish.{Newline}
We've no intention of laying down arms{Newline}
until Prince Orinus sits the throne that{Newline}
is his birthright.{Newline}
You will not steer the helm of Ivalice at{Newline}
your own pleasure. Not so long as this{Newline}
house stands.
{MClose}
Do you not know who made your{Newline}
assassination of the duke possible?
{MClose}
I mislike the question.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
Larg was felled by a Southern Sky{Newline}
assassin.{Newline}
{Newline}
Or do you mean to say that you were{Newline}
the ones who sent him?
{MClose}
I'll not play at this fool's game.{Newline}
There is to be no convincing you,{Newline}
then?
{MClose}
Were it our desire, we could crush{Newline}
the templarate like an overripe{Newline}
grape.{Newline}
Of that I am quite convinced.
{MClose}
Pray remove that fine white cloak{Newline}
beforehand. Burst grapes oft leave{Newline}
a fearsome stain.{Newline}
Tell me, this poison employed at{Newline}
Besselat—do you know what it was?
{MClose}
I believe it was an extract of{Newline}
mossfungus spores.
{MClose}
So it was. An insidious thing, mossfungus.{Newline}
It takes a great quantity to kill a man, but{Newline}
the toxin never leaves the blood.{Newline}
The smallest, most undetectable of doses{Newline}
will prove lethal, if repeated oft enough.
{MClose}
...
{MClose}
Even a learned eye might confuse the{Newline}
symptoms with those of common affliction.{Newline}
{Newline}
Oft as not, the person being poisoned is{Newline}
never even aware. And should they become{Newline}
so, it is almost invariably too late.
{MClose}
Your late lord father was taken by malady,{Newline}
was he not?
{MClose}
Do you make some implication?
{MClose}
I'm told you yourself have some knowledge{Newline}
in poisoncraft.
{MClose}
What of it?
{MClose}
I recently learned an interesting fact.{Newline}
I had wondered if you might be aware{Newline}
of it.{Newline}
Mossfungus poisoning leaves spores in{Newline}
the body. When a victim is buried, they{Newline}
say toadstools sprout above the grave.
{MClose}
Forgive me, I digress.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
Ah, yes, there was another matter—{Newline}
a gift from High Confessor Marcel.
{MClose}
A gemstone?
{MClose}
It is a Zodiac Stone—a blessed crystal{Newline}
from Mullonde.{Newline}
{Newline}
The High Confessor wished for you to{Newline}
have it. Please accept it as a symbol{Newline}
of the Church's good faith.

There is but one host fit for the High Seraph.{Newline}

We have a score to settle from Riovanes.

Do not make light of him. He is a worthy foe.{Newline}
Not even Belias could stand before him.

You needn't worry about me. I shall{Newline}

In this session, we shall delve into how to{Newline}
control your units on the battlefield.{Newline}
{Newline}
Since the battlefield is a three-dimensional{Newline}
environment, you may view it from a{Newline}
variety of angles.{Newline}
Use the L and R buttons and the analog stick{Newline}
to adjust your view of the battlefield.{Newline}
{Newline}
The analog stick rotates your view of{Newline}
the battlefield.
{MClose}
The L button zooms the camera in and out,{Newline}
and the R button toggles the camera height.
{MClose}
Try using these controls now.{Newline}
Press START when you are finished.
{MClose}
You may also scroll across the screen by holding{Newline}
down □ and using the directional buttons.{Newline}
{Newline}
Try it now, and press START when finished.
{MClose}
You will need to master these controls if you{Newline}
want to be aware of what is occurring on{Newline}
the battlefield.{Newline}
Next, we will cover the battlefield cursor.
{MClose}
The battlefield cursor is used to select units{Newline}
or tiles on the battlefield.{Newline}
{Newline}
The cursor's height (h) is displayed in the upper{Newline}
right corner of the screen, and the selected{Newline}
unit's status is displayed at the bottom.{Newline}
Press ○ to close the menu, then use the{Newline}
directional buttons to move the battlefield{Newline}
cursor.{Newline}
Press START when you are finished.
{MClose}
The cursor is used to select a unit's{Newline}
movement destination or attack target.{Newline}
{Newline}
Battlefields are often made up of complex{Newline}
terrain, and some locations may be inaccessible.{Newline}
{Newline}
The cursor is normally blue, but it will turn red{Newline}
when moved over a tile inaccessible to the unit.{Newline}
{Newline}
You now know the basics of controlling the{Newline}
battlefield cursor.{Newline}
{Newline}
Let us move on to something a bit more{Newline}
advanced.{Newline}
{Newline}
Sometimes you will encounter tiles that are{Newline}
above other ones.{Newline}
{Newline}
For example, you may be able to move over or{Newline}
under a bridge.
{MClose}
Allow me to explain how to use the cursor in{Newline}
a case like this.{Newline}
{Newline}
First, move the cursor to either the upper or{Newline}
lower tile, then wait after moving the cursor.{Newline}
{Newline}
It will automatically begin to toggle between{Newline}
the upper and lower tiles.
{MClose}
Simply make your selection when the cursor{Newline}
is on the correct tile.{Newline}
{Newline}
Try it now. Press START when you are{Newline}
finished.
{MClose}
You may adjust the speed of the cursor when{Newline}
switching between levels by using option 3,{Newline}
"Multi-height Toggle Rate."{Newline}
If this option is turned off, the cursor will{Newline}
not move automatically.{Newline}
{Newline}
Instead, you must press START to toggle{Newline}
between different levels.{Newline}
{Newline}
There are also two other special ways of{Newline}
moving the cursor, related to the units' turn{Newline}
order.{Newline}
To move the cursor automatically to the{Newline}
active unit, move the cursor to an empty{Newline}
tile and press ×.{Newline}
Repeatedly pressing START will cycle{Newline}
the cursor from unit to unit in turn order.{Newline}
{Newline}
This is useful for determining the order in{Newline}
which units will act.{Newline}
{Newline}
However, you cannot use this method if you{Newline}
are using START to switch between multiple{Newline}
levels.
{MClose}
Now allow me to explain the commands you may{Newline}
use when selecting a unit with the cursor.{Newline}
{Newline}
If you move the cursor to one of your units and{Newline}
press ×, the unit's battle menu will appear.
{MClose}
In addition, if you press ○ when a unit is{Newline}
selected by the cursor, that unit's range of{Newline}
movement will be displayed.
{MClose}
This concludes our discussion of the{Newline}
battlefield cursor.{Newline}
{Newline}
Using the cursor is one of the fundamentals{Newline}
of battle, so please do your best to remember{Newline}
what you have learned here.{Newline}
With that, I shall bring this lesson to a close.

{Color 08}Master Darlavon{Newline}
{Color 00}Now then, let us begin the lesson.{Newline}
{Newline}
In this session we shall explore the{Newline}
fundamentals of battle, from beginning to end.{Newline}
{Newline}
Firstly, you must select the units you wish to{Newline}
use in battle and position them on the field.{Newline}
{Newline}
The number of units you may use in battle{Newline}
varies depending upon the situation, but in{Newline}
general, you are limited to five.{Newline}
In some cases, you may need to split your{Newline}
units into two separate squads.{Newline}
{Newline}
If you always use the same units in battle,{Newline}
their advancement will soon outpace that of{Newline}
your other units.{Newline}
When selecting units to use in battle, keep{Newline}
in mind both their skills and their need for{Newline}
advancement.{Newline}
Sometimes allied units will appear in battle{Newline}
without your having selected them. These{Newline}
are known as guest units.
{MClose}
Guest units have their own agendas{Newline}
and will move and act on their own.
{MClose}
Once you have selected your units, you will{Newline}
move to the battlefield.{Newline}
{Newline}
And then, battle will begin—but we are getting{Newline}
ahead of ourselves. First, we must discuss{Newline}
objectives.{Newline}
For example, this...
{MClose}
Or, this...
{MClose}
Messages such as these will appear as each{Newline}
battle begins, telling you what you must do{Newline}
in order to win.{Newline}
In general, you must defeat all of the enemies,{Newline}
but in some cases, you must fulfill other special{Newline}
conditions.
{MClose}
Once the battle has begun, each of your units{Newline}
will move and act in turn.{Newline}
{Newline}
When it is a unit's turn to move and act, he or{Newline}
she will be designated by the AT icon, which{Newline}
stands for Active Turn.{Newline}
A unit's turn comes when his or her charge{Newline}
time (CT) gauge reaches 100.{Newline}
{Newline}
A unit's Speed attribute determines how much{Newline}
his or her CT gauge fills with each tick of{Newline}
the game clock.{Newline}
During a unit's turn, he or she may move and{Newline}
perform actions such as attacking an enemy.{Newline}
{Newline}
Let's examine the battle menu, shall we?
{MClose}
The Move, Act, and Wait commands are{Newline}
displayed only when it is the unit's turn.{Newline}
{Newline}
A unit may move once and act once during{Newline}
his or her turn.{Newline}
{Newline}
If the unit has both moved and performed{Newline}
an action, his or her turn will automatically{Newline}
come to an end.{Newline}
The Wait command is used to end the turn if{Newline}
the unit will only be moving or acting, or if he{Newline}
or she will do nothing.{Newline}
Next, let's examine the other commands.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
Status allows you to check a unit's detailed{Newline}
status.
{MClose}
The AI command allows you to set an AI{Newline}
pattern for the unit so that it will decide{Newline}
its own actions.{Newline}
Units that use AI will move and fight{Newline}
automatically until the AI command is{Newline}
canceled.
{MClose}
You may select from four different AI{Newline}
strategies.{Newline}
{Newline}
Berserker will cause the unit to attack its{Newline}
target without regard for his or her own{Newline}
safety.{Newline}
Defender will cause the unit to protect a{Newline}
friendly target without regard for his or{Newline}
her own safety.{Newline}
Healer will cause the unit to focus upon{Newline}
restoring the HP and MP of allied units.{Newline}
{Newline}
Coward will cause the unit to attempt to{Newline}
escape to a safe location while recovering{Newline}
his or her own HP.{Newline}
For Berserker and Defender, you must{Newline}
select a target for the unit to attack or{Newline}
protect.{Newline}
Once a unit's AI has been enabled, that unit{Newline}
will fight automatically from then on.{Newline}
{Newline}
To cancel this setting, select the AI command{Newline}
and choose Manual.{Newline}
{Newline}
However, since the unit will be acting{Newline}
automatically, you cannot access the unit's{Newline}
menu on his or her own turn.{Newline}
You must cancel the setting during another{Newline}
unit's turn or after pausing the battle.
{MClose}
The Status and AI commands may be selected{Newline}
even if it is not the selected unit's turn.{Newline}
{Newline}
Normally, the menu will not appear for an{Newline}
enemy unit or a unit which has been set to{Newline}
use AI.{Newline}
However, you may halt the course of battle{Newline}
and force a menu to appear by pressing △.{Newline}
{Newline}
Doing so will open a menu on the next unit's{Newline}
turn.
{MClose}
This allows you to stop units using AI, or to{Newline}
view the status of enemy units.{Newline}
{Newline}
You will not be able to give commands{Newline}
to any of your units while the battle is{Newline}
stopped in this way.{Newline}
To resume the battle (assuming the current{Newline}
unit is not set to AI), select "Done."{Newline}
{Newline}
This command may be found at the{Newline}
bottom of the menu.
{MClose}
This concludes my overview of battle commands.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
To summarize, you may select "Move," "Act,"{Newline}
or "Wait" during a unit's turn, as well as check{Newline}
the unit's status.{Newline}
In some cases, you may wish to set an AI{Newline}
pattern for a unit. To resume the battle after{Newline}
it has been interrupted, select "Done."{Newline}
These are the main commands that you will{Newline}
use in the course of a battle.
{MClose}
Next is a most unpleasant subject.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
When a unit's HP reaches zero, the unit{Newline}
will be KO'd.
{MClose}
If you do not revive a KO'd unit within a{Newline}
certain amount of time, the unit's body{Newline}
will disappear.{Newline}
In its place, a treasure chest or crystal will{Newline}
appear.
{MClose}
Once a unit has disappeared in this way,{Newline}
there is no way of reviving it. The unit is{Newline}
gone forever.{Newline}
If one of your units is KO'd, do your best to{Newline}
revive him or her as quickly as possible.{Newline}
{Newline}
If all of your units are KO'd, the game is over.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
Always keep an eye upon your units'{Newline}
remaining HP to prevent this from happening.{Newline}
{Newline}
I recommend that you always bring at least{Newline}
one unit who is capable of healing or reviving{Newline}
KO'd units.{Newline}
On the other hand, KO'ing all enemy units{Newline}
on the battlefield will end the battle, assuming{Newline}
you have fulfilled the battle objective.
{MClose}
This concludes our battle overview and my{Newline}
explanation of the battle menu.{Newline}
{Newline}
I trust you will make good use of this{Newline}
information on the battlefield.{Newline}
{Newline}
With that, I shall bring this lesson to a close.
{MClose}
The Status and AI commands may be selected{Newline}
even if it is not the selected unit's turn.{Newline}
{Newline}
Normally, the menu will not appear for an{Newline}
enemy unit or a unit which has been set to{Newline}
use AI.{Newline}
However, you may halt the course of battle{Newline}
and force a menu to appear by pressing △.{Newline}
{Newline}
Doing so will open a menu on the next unit's{Newline}
turn.{Newline}
{Newline}
This allows you to stop units using AI, or to{Newline}
view the status of enemy units.{Newline}
{Newline}
You will not be able to give commands{Newline}
to any of your units while the battle is{Newline}
stopped in this way.{Newline}
To resume the battle (assuming the current{Newline}
unit is not set to AI), select "Done."{Newline}
{Newline}
This command may be found at the{Newline}
bottom of the menu.
{MClose}
This concludes my overview of battle commands.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
To summarize, you may select "Move," "Act,"{Newline}
or "Wait" during a unit's turn, as well as check{Newline}
the unit's status.{Newline}
In some cases, you may wish to set an AI{Newline}
pattern for a unit. To resume the battle after{Newline}
it has been interrupted, select "Done."{Newline}
These are the main commands that you will{Newline}
use in the course of a battle.

{Color 08}Master Darlavon{Newline}
{Color 00}Now then, let us begin the lesson.{Newline}
{Newline}
In this session, I shall explain movement and{Newline}
actions.{Newline}
{Newline}
A unit is allowed one move and one action{Newline}
during his or her turn.{Newline}
{Newline}
Let's try controlling a unit as he moves{Newline}
and acts.{Newline}
{Newline}
First, you must move your unit to a tile{Newline}
next to the enemy you wish to attack.{Newline}
{Newline}
Try selecting "Move."
{MClose}
As you can see, the tiles around your unit are{Newline}
flashing blue.{Newline}
{Newline}
These blue tiles indicate the movement range{Newline}
of your unit. You must select a destination from{Newline}
among these tiles.{Newline}
But first, allow me to explain how a unit's{Newline}
movement range is determined.{Newline}
{Newline}
Each unit's range of movement is determined by{Newline}
his or her Move and Jump attributes.{Newline}
{Newline}
On flat terrain, a unit may move a number of{Newline}
tiles in one turn equal to the unit's Move{Newline}
attribute.{Newline}
So, if a unit's Move is 4, he or she may move{Newline}
4 tiles.{Newline}
{Newline}
Likewise, the unit may perform a vertical jump{Newline}
to a height equaling his or her Jump attribute.{Newline}
{Newline}
He or she may also jump horizontally for a{Newline}
distance equaling half his or her Jump attribute.{Newline}
{Newline}
So, a unit with a Jump of 3 could jump{Newline}
horizontally over a 1-tile gap, or jump up{Newline}
or down 3 levels.{Newline}
In this case, "levels" refer to the difference{Newline}
between the height of the unit's current tile and{Newline}
that of the target tile.{Newline}
Now then, let us continue practicing movement.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
Once the unit's movement range is displayed,{Newline}
select a destination.{Newline}
{Newline}
If there is an allied chocobo on the tile you{Newline}
select, your unit will mount that chocobo.
{MClose}
Now try approaching the enemy by selecting{Newline}
the tile directly in front of him.
{MClose}
Since a unit may only move once per turn, the{Newline}
Move command is now grayed out and cannot{Newline}
be selected.{Newline}
Now try attacking with a weapon.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
To do this, you must select the Attack{Newline}
command.{Newline}
{Newline}
Try it now. Select "Act" and then "Attack."
{MClose}
The tiles around your unit have turned red.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
This indicates the unit's attack range.{Newline}
He may attack any unit on a red tile.{Newline}
{Newline}
Allow me to explain a bit about attack range.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
A unit's attack range is determined by the{Newline}
weapon a unit has equipped, as well as his{Newline}
or her abilities.{Newline}
For example, a sword has a range of only one{Newline}
tile, but a bow allows a unit to extend his or{Newline}
her attack to tiles that are quite far away.{Newline}
Magicks generally have a long range as well.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
Next, try selecting your target. Move the{Newline}
cursor to your enemy and press ×.
{MClose}
Notice that the enemy unit's tile has turned{Newline}
green.{Newline}
{Newline}
Green tiles indicate the attack's area of{Newline}
effect.{Newline}
{Newline}
The area of effect depends upon the weapon{Newline}
a unit has equipped, as well as his or her{Newline}
abilities.{Newline}
Most weapons have an area of effect of just{Newline}
one tile, but magicks may affect many tiles{Newline}
at once.{Newline}
The status of each unit is displayed at the{Newline}
bottom of the screen.{Newline}
{Newline}
On the left is the attacking unit, and on the{Newline}
right is his or her target.{Newline}
{Newline}
The attacking unit's turn order, level,{Newline}
and EXP are not shown here.{Newline}
{Newline}
In place of them, you will see an estimate{Newline}
of the attack's effect. The HP value listed{Newline}
here is the estimated amount of damage.{Newline}
To the right is the probability that{Newline}
the attack will succeed.{Newline}
{Newline}
By checking these, you can get a good idea of{Newline}
how effective an attack will be against a{Newline}
particular enemy.{Newline}
For standard attacks, only the damage{Newline}
estimate and chance of success are{Newline}
displayed.{Newline}
For magicks that cause status effects, the{Newline}
status effect's name and its chance of being{Newline}
inflicted will also be displayed.{Newline}
If the targeted unit has a reaction ability,{Newline}
the name of that ability will appear beneath{Newline}
the unit's status display.{Newline}
In battle, it is important to check all of{Newline}
these when choosing a target.{Newline}
{Newline}
You should also note that a unit's Bravery,{Newline}
Faith, and zodiac sign all affect the damage{Newline}
and success rate of attacks.{Newline}
A unit's Bravery also affects its bare-handed{Newline}
Attack attribute and the chance that its{Newline}
reaction ability will be triggered.{Newline}
Faith affects the damage and success rate{Newline}
of a unit's magick attacks.{Newline}
{Newline}
For example, a unit with high Faith inflicts{Newline}
more damage when casting Firaga, and is{Newline}
more like to successfully cast Raise.{Newline}
The relationship between the zodiac signs{Newline}
of the attacker and defender also affects{Newline}
damage and success rate.{Newline}
If the two signs are compatible, attacks{Newline}
will do more damage and healing magicks{Newline}
will be more effective.{Newline}
If the two signs are incompatible, damage{Newline}
will be reduced, as will the success rate{Newline}
of magicks.{Newline}
The estimated results of an attack take{Newline}
into account Faith, Bravery, and zodiac{Newline}
sign compatibility.{Newline}
Now then, let us continue by selecting the{Newline}
target.{Newline}
{Newline}
Once you have checked the area of effect{Newline}
and estimated results, you may confirm{Newline}
your target.{Newline}
Press × to confirm the selection.
{MClose}
If an attack is successful, the attacker will{Newline}
gain experience points (EXP) and job points{Newline}
(JP).{Newline}
After a unit has both moved and acted, {Newline}
his or her turn will automatically end.{Newline}
{Newline}
When a unit's turn ends, you must choose his or{Newline}
her facing. This affects the probability of the{Newline}
unit evading enemy attacks.{Newline}
You will want to be facing the enemy whenever{Newline}
possible.
{MClose}
That concludes my explanation of{Newline}
movement and actions.{Newline}
{Newline}
You shall be repeating these steps many times{Newline}
as you battle your foes.{Newline}
{Newline}
This is one of the fundamentals of battle, so{Newline}
please do your best to remember what you{Newline}
have learned here.{Newline}
With that, I shall bring this lesson to a close.

determined by their charge time (CT).{Newline}
{Newline}
Once a unit's CT gauge fills up, that unit's{Newline}
turn has arrived.{Newline}
{Newline}
You may check a unit's charge time by looking{Newline}
at his or her CT gauge.{Newline}
{Newline}
The CT gauge is located below the unit's{Newline}
HP and MP.
{MClose}
This gauge, located at the bottom of a unit's{Newline}
status display in the lower left corner of the{Newline}
screen, represents his or her charge time.{Newline}
Once this gauge reaches 100, it is fully{Newline}
charged and it becomes the unit's turn to{Newline}
move and act.{Newline}
The CT gauges of all units fill with each tick{Newline}
of the game clock, but the rate at which{Newline}
they fill is different for each unit.{Newline}
Because of this, some units will see their{Newline}
turns come more quickly than others.{Newline}
{Newline}
Allow me to explain a bit more about how the{Newline}
CT gauge fills.
{MClose}
Here is the unit's status screen.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
Look at the left side of the middle panel.{Newline}
You will see an attribute labeled Speed.
{MClose}
Allow me to give an example.
{MClose}
This unit has a Speed of 9.
{MClose}
This unit has a Speed of 6.
{MClose}
Let us observe how their CT gauges fill.

As you can see, the unit with a Speed of 9{Newline}
sees his turn come earlier.{Newline}
{Newline}
Of course, in an actual battle, you do not{Newline}
have to wait while the CT gauges fill up.{Newline}
{Newline}
The active turn will automatically advance{Newline}
to whichever unit has the next turn.{Newline}
{Newline}
Now you know how the CT gauge works.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
A unit's Speed is added to the gauge for{Newline}
each tick of the game clock, until the gauge{Newline}
reaches 100. Then it is the unit's turn.{Newline}
Thus, the higher a unit's Speed, the more{Newline}
often he or she will receive a turn.
{MClose}
Even understanding how the CT gauge{Newline}
controls turn order, it is difficult to keep{Newline}
track of the turn order for all units.{Newline}
So, I shall teach you a simple method of{Newline}
checking the turn order in battle.
{MClose}
Look at the status display at the bottom of the{Newline}
screen. There are two numbers to the upper right{Newline}
of the unit's portrait.{Newline}
The number to the left of the slash indicates{Newline}
that unit's turn order. The number to the right{Newline}
is the total number of units on the battlefield.{Newline}
Thus, to see an estimate of when a unit will get{Newline}
his or her turn, you merely have to move the{Newline}
cursor to the unit's tile and check this number.{Newline}
I say "estimate," because in some cases the{Newline}
CT gauge will be filled in an irregular fashion.{Newline}
{Newline}
In particular, I am referring to what happens{Newline}
when a unit chooses the Wait command.
{MClose}
A unit can use the Wait command when he{Newline}
or she only wants to move or act, or does{Newline}
not wish to do anything.{Newline}
Normally, when a unit's turn ends, the CT{Newline}
gauge resets to zero.{Newline}
{Newline}
But when a unit ends his or her turn by{Newline}
selecting "Wait," the gauge will start its{Newline}
next count from 20 or even 40.{Newline}
When a unit selects the command after{Newline}
moving or acting, the gauge will be reset{Newline}
to 20.{Newline}
When a unit chooses to wait without{Newline}
moving or acting at all, the gauge will{Newline}
be reset to 40.{Newline}
In other words, the time until the unit's next{Newline}
turn will be shortened.{Newline}
{Newline}
This may sometimes change the turn order{Newline}
of the units on the battlefield.{Newline}
{Newline}
If you plan carefully, you can use the{Newline}
Wait command to your advantage.
{MClose}
This concludes my explanation of the CT{Newline}
gauge and turn order.{Newline}
{Newline}
Let us review.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
A unit's turn comes when his or her CT gauge{Newline}
reaches 100.{Newline}
{Newline}
With every tick of the game clock, a unit's{Newline}
CT gauge increases by an amount equal to{Newline}
the unit's Speed attribute.{Newline}
Thus, the higher a unit's Speed, the more{Newline}
often he or she will receive a turn.{Newline}
{Newline}
Understanding these concepts should allow you{Newline}
to gain the upper hand in any battle.{Newline}
{Newline}
With that, I shall bring this lesson to a close.
{MClose}
Every time the CT gauge is incremented, the{Newline}
value increases by an amount equal to the{Newline}
unit's Speed.{Newline}
This means that units with a high Speed will{Newline}
see their CT gauges fill more quickly.

{Color 08}Master Darlavon{Newline}
{Color 00}Now then, let us begin the lesson.{Newline}
{Newline}
In this session we shall discuss how to use{Newline}
magicks.{Newline}
{Newline}
As with units, each magick has a charge time,{Newline}
which starts when a unit begins to cast it,{Newline}
and ends when the magick goes into effect.{Newline}
Each magick also has a Speed attribute that{Newline}
affects how quickly it charges.{Newline}
{Newline}
The charge time for magicks begins when a{Newline}
unit starts to cast them.{Newline}
{Newline}
If the unit's next turn arrives before the{Newline}
casting is complete, the unit cannot perform{Newline}
another action without canceling the magick.{Newline}
If the unit chooses the Wait command, it will{Newline}
continue casting. The unit may also move{Newline}
without interrupting the casting.{Newline}
Perhaps the easiest way to learn about magick{Newline}
is to actually use it.{Newline}
{Newline}
First, select "Act" from the unit's menu.
{MClose}
Now select "Black Magicks."
{MClose}
The black magicks available to this unit{Newline}
are displayed.{Newline}
{Newline}
Magicks that are marked with the ☇ icon{Newline}
may be reflected with the Reflect ability.{Newline}
{Newline}
The MP cost of casting the magick is shown{Newline}
in the column labeled "MP."{Newline}
{Newline}
The "Turn" column indicates when the magick{Newline}
will actually go into effect.{Newline}
{Newline}
All magicks require time to cast.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
The Turn value tells you when the unit{Newline}
will finish casting the magick in the{Newline}
current turn order.{Newline}
It is calculated based on the casting{Newline}
unit's turn order and the amount of time{Newline}
it takes to cast the magick.{Newline}
You can press the left or right button to{Newline}
see more detailed information.{Newline}
{Newline}
Move the cursor to the spell whose timing{Newline}
you wish to check, and press the left or{Newline}
right button now.
{MClose}
Empty
{MClose}
The turn list is displayed. The flashing row{Newline}
with the casting unit's name and the magick's{Newline}
name indicates when the magick will be cast.{Newline}
This list may also be viewed at any time by{Newline}
pressing △ and selecting "Turn List."{Newline}
{Newline}
Now press ○ to return to the spell selection{Newline}
menu.
{MClose}
For now, try casting the first spell{Newline}
on the list.
{MClose}
The red tiles around the unit indicate the{Newline}
magick's range.{Newline}
{Newline}
You may select any of these tiles as the{Newline}
target.{Newline}
{Newline}
The targeted unit or units will be damaged{Newline}
by offensive magicks, or aided by support{Newline}
magicks.{Newline}
Select that enemy unit's tile as your target.
{MClose}
The green tiles around the target indicate{Newline}
the magick's area of effect.{Newline}
{Newline}
Any units within the the area of effect{Newline}
will be affected.{Newline}
{Newline}
Since you are casting an offensive magick,{Newline}
units in the area of effect will be damaged.{Newline}
{Newline}
Note that allied units and enemy units will{Newline}
flash in different colors to help you{Newline}
distinguish friend from foe.{Newline}
Note that both allies and enemies can be{Newline}
damaged by your magicks.{Newline}
{Newline}
Therefore, you should always ensure that{Newline}
there are no blue flashing units in the{Newline}
area of effect.{Newline}
You may turn off the flashing color effect{Newline}
with option 10, "Target Colors."{Newline}
{Newline}
Press × again to confirm your target.
{MClose}
Next, choose whether you wish to target the{Newline}
unit or the tile beneath him.{Newline}
{Newline}
If you select "Unit," that unit will remain{Newline}
the magick's target, even if he or she moves{Newline}
while it is being cast.{Newline}
If you select "Tile" and the unit moves{Newline}
while the magick is being cast, the magick{Newline}
will be cast upon the empty tile.{Newline}
Choosing "Unit" ensures that a magick will affect{Newline}
the targeted unit. But if the unit moves, the{Newline}
magick may then affect your own units as well.{Newline}
This time, let's select the unit as our target.
{MClose}
Only one magick may be cast at a time. Starting{Newline}
another action before the initial magick has{Newline}
been cast will cancel it.{Newline}
This concludes my explanation of magicks.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
Let us review. Like units, magicks have a{Newline}
charge time requirement and a Speed attribute.{Newline}
{Newline}
Keep in mind the amount of time required to{Newline}
cast magicks when choosing one.{Newline}
{Newline}
When casting a magick, you must select a target{Newline}
within its range. The magick will affect all{Newline}
tiles in its area of effect.{Newline}
You may choose to cast a magick on either a{Newline}
unit or a tile.{Newline}
{Newline}
If you cast a magick on a unit, the magick's{Newline}
area of effect will move along with the{Newline}
targeted unit.{Newline}
If you cast a magick on a tile and there are no{Newline}
units within the area of effect when the magick{Newline}
is finally cast, the magick will be wasted.{Newline}
Keep these points in mind to make the most{Newline}
of your units' magicks.{Newline}
{Newline}
With that, I shall bring this lesson to a close.
{MClose}
Understanding these concepts should allow you{Newline}
to gain the upper hand in any battle you fight.{Newline}
{Newline}
With that, I shall bring this lesson to a close.
{MClose}
Every time the CT gauge goes up, it increases{Newline}
by an amount equal to the unit's Speed.{Newline}
{Newline}
This means that units with a high Speed will{Newline}
see their CT gauges fill up more quickly.
{MClose}
If the attack was successful, the unit will gain{Newline}
experience points (EXP) and job points (JP).{Newline}
{Newline}
After a unit has both moved and acted, {Newline}
his or her turn will automatically end.{Newline}
{Newline}
When a unit's turn ends, you must choose his or{Newline}
her facing. This affects the probability of him{Newline}
or her dodging enemy attacks.{Newline}
You will want to be facing the enemy whenever{Newline}
possible.
{MClose}
This concludes my explanation of{Newline}
movement and actions.{Newline}
{Newline}
You will be repeating these steps many times{Newline}
as you battle your foes.{Newline}
{Newline}
This is one of the fundamentals of battle, so{Newline}
please do your best to remember what you{Newline}
have learned here.{Newline}
With that, I shall bring this lesson to a close.

A status effect refers to a variety of{Newline}
conditions that may affect a unit on the{Newline}
battlefield.{Newline}
In general, these may be divided into four{Newline}
groups: beneficial statuses, status ailments,{Newline}
physical states, and action states.{Newline}
Firstly, let us discuss the various action states{Newline}
a unit may be in as a result of using abilities.
{MClose}
There are 3 different action states: charging,{Newline}
performing, and defending.{Newline}
{Newline}
These states are generally canceled once the{Newline}
unit's next turn arrives, or when an ability{Newline}
goes into effect.
{MClose}
The magick has been cast, so the black mage's{Newline}
charging state has now been canceled.{Newline}
{Newline}
Next, I shall explain beneficial statuses.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
A beneficial status is a positive effect that is{Newline}
brought about by an ability or spell.{Newline}
{Newline}
These may gradually restore the unit's HP,{Newline}
or increase the unit's Speed attribute.
{MClose}
For example, the Protect magick increases a{Newline}
unit's resistance to physical attacks.{Newline}
{Newline}
Thus, the affected unit will take less damage{Newline}
from physical attacks.{Newline}
{Newline}
There are many other beneficial statuses.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
Beneficial statuses may be removed by means{Newline}
of the mystic's Harmony ability.
{MClose}
Next, we shall discuss status ailments.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
These negative statuses include curses or{Newline}
magick effects that adversely affect a unit.{Newline}
{Newline}
These may cause the unit to act randomly,{Newline}
be unable to move or act, or have its HP{Newline}
gradually drained.
{MClose}
One example of this is the Blind status.{Newline}
When blinded, a unit's chance of striking a{Newline}
blow in combat is decreased.{Newline}
There are many other types of status{Newline}
ailments.
{MClose}
If the effect of a status ailment is adversely{Newline}
affecting a unit's performance in battle, it is{Newline}
best to remove it.{Newline}
Status ailments may be removed by using a{Newline}
remedy, or with the white magick Esuna.
{MClose}
However, these may not be effective against{Newline}
all status ailments.{Newline}
{Newline}
There are additional ways of removing status{Newline}
ailments as well.{Newline}
{Newline}
For example, a unit who has been turned to{Newline}
stone may also be restored by using a{Newline}
gold needle.{Newline}
However, a unit who has been turned undead{Newline}
may only be restored by using holy water.{Newline}
{Newline}
For more information about how to remove{Newline}
status effects, refer to the quick help{Newline}
descriptions.
{MClose}
Lastly, allow me to explain about physical{Newline}
states.{Newline}
{Newline}
There are two physical states: Critical and{Newline}
KO.
{MClose}
A critically wounded unit may have his or{Newline}
her HP restored with the white magick Cure{Newline}
or with a potion.{Newline}
A KO'd unit may be revived with the white{Newline}
magick Raise or with phoenix down.
{MClose}
The Critical state has no particular adverse{Newline}
effects on a unit, but a KO'd unit cannot{Newline}
act on his or her own.{Newline}
Prepare in advance to keep your units from{Newline}
being KO'd.{Newline}
{Newline}
It is always advisable to bring at least one{Newline}
unit with abilities that allow it to heal or{Newline}
revive other units.{Newline}
If you do not revive a KO'd unit within a{Newline}
certain amount of time, its body will{Newline}
disappear.{Newline}
In its place, a treasure chest or crystal will{Newline}
appear.{Newline}
{Newline}
Once a unit has disappeared in this way,{Newline}
reviving him or her will be impossible.{Newline}
The unit is gone forever.{Newline}
Crystals and treasure chests left behind{Newline}
by KO'd units may be obtained by moving{Newline}
units onto the tiles they occupy.{Newline}
Treasure chests contain items.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
Crystals restore a unit's HP and MP.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
In some cases, crystals allow the units that{Newline}
obtain them to acquire the abilities of{Newline}
the units who left them behind.{Newline}
The units will instantly learn the new{Newline}
abilities without having to spend job{Newline}
points.
{MClose}
This concludes my discussion of status{Newline}
effects.{Newline}
{Newline}
Always do your best to use items and{Newline}
white magicks to prevent your units from{Newline}
being KO'd.{Newline}
With that, I shall bring this lesson to a close.

{Color 08}Master Darlavon{Newline}
{Color 00}Now then, let us begin the lesson.{Newline}
{Newline}
In this session, we shall discuss the game's{Newline}
help system.{Newline}
{Newline}
During battle, you may wish to know the{Newline}
meaning of a command, the effects of an{Newline}
ability, or the range of a weapon.{Newline}
Just select the command, ability, or{Newline}
item with the cursor and press SELECT.
{MClose}
A help message like the previous one{Newline}
will appear.{Newline}
{Newline}
There are help messages for a wide{Newline}
variety of features in the game.{Newline}
{Newline}
So, if you require additional help on{Newline}
a subject, first try pressing SELECT.{Newline}
{Newline}
Let us try researching the effects{Newline}
of a spell.
{MClose}
If you press SELECT before using an ability,{Newline}
you may check its effects or range.{Newline}
{Newline}
Let's examine some of the abbreviations{Newline}
used in the help messages.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Color 08}Range{Color 00} is the attack range.{Newline}
{Color 08}Radius{Color 00} is the radius of the area of effect.{Newline}
{Color 08}MP{Color 00} is the number of MP consumed.{Newline}
{Color 08}Speed{Color 00} is the ability's Speed attribute.{Newline}
☇ means that the magick may be reflected{Newline}
by the Reflect ability.{Newline}
"Arithmeticks" indicates a spell that may be{Newline}
used with arithmeticks.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Color 08}Removes{Color 00} indicates status effects that{Newline}
the ability removes.{Newline}
{Color 08}Effect{Color 00} is the inflicted status effect.{Newline}
Also, the range or radius of an ability may{Newline}
be limited vertically. This is indicated by{Newline}
"Vert." followed by a number.{Newline}
This value represents the vertical reach.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
Try using the help system to view information{Newline}
about this unit's spells. Press START when{Newline}
you are finished.
{MClose}
The help system is especially useful for{Newline}
checking the details of abilities or status{Newline}
effects during battle.{Newline}
Just remember that should you find anything{Newline}
you do not understand, you can select it with{Newline}
the cursor and press SELECT for help.{Newline}
With that, I shall bring this lesson to a close.

{Color 08}Master Darlavon{Newline}
{Color 00}Now then, let us begin the lesson.{Newline}
{Newline}
In this session, I shall explain how to change{Newline}
the game options and what each option means.{Newline}
{Newline}
You may use the options menu to change a{Newline}
variety of game settings.{Newline}
{Newline}
The options menu may be accessed both from{Newline}
the world map and from the battlefield.{Newline}
{Newline}
On the battlefield, press △ in free cursor{Newline}
mode to open the menu.{Newline}
{Newline}
First, press ○ to close the battle menu and{Newline}
enter free cursor mode.
{MClose}
You are now in free cursor mode. In this{Newline}
mode, you may freely move the cursor{Newline}
using the directional buttons.{Newline}
Now press △ to open the menu, and{Newline}
select "Options."
{MClose}
This is the options menu.{Newline}
Let us examine each option.{Newline}
{Newline}
1. Cursor Movement lets you change{Newline}
how the cursor moves on the battlefield.
{MClose}
With Type A, pressing the up button{Newline}
moves the cursor toward the upper{Newline}
right.{Newline}
With Type B, pressing the up button{Newline}
moves the cursor toward the upper left.
{MClose}
2. Cursor Repeat Rate controls how quickly{Newline}
the cursor moves across the battlefield.
{MClose}
3. Multi-height Toggle Rate controls how{Newline}
quickly the cursor moves between two levels,{Newline}
such as tiles on and below a bridge.
{MClose}
Selecting "Off" will prevent the cursor from{Newline}
moving automatically. Instead, you must press{Newline}
START to switch levels.
{MClose}
4. Menu Cursor Speed controls the speed{Newline}
of the finger cursor when moving through{Newline}
menus.
{MClose}
5. Message Speed allows you to{Newline}
adjust the display speed of dialogue{Newline}
and system messages.
{MClose}
6. Battle Prompts allows you to toggle{Newline}
the display of messages during battle{Newline}
that explain the game controls.
{MClose}
7. Display Ability Names controls whether{Newline}
ability and magick names are displayed when{Newline}
they are used.
{MClose}
8. Display Effect Messages controls whether{Newline}
the effects of actions are displayed.
{MClose}
9. Display Earned EXP/JP controls{Newline}
whether experience and job points obtained{Newline}
by units are displayed on-screen during battle.
{MClose}
10. Target Colors controls whether enemies{Newline}
and allies are highlighted in different{Newline}
colors when selecting a target.{Newline}
This makes it easier to distinguish between{Newline}
allies and enemies.
{MClose}
11. Display Unequippable Items affects which{Newline}
items are displayed when equipping a unit.{Newline}
{Newline}
If this is set to "Off," items that cannot be{Newline}
equipped by a certain unit will not be included{Newline}
in the item list for that unit.
{MClose}
12. Optimize on Job Change affects the{Newline}
items equipped on a unit when changing his{Newline}
or her job or assigning new abilities.{Newline}
When this option is turned on, the strongest{Newline}
equipment will be automatically selected for a{Newline}
unit when his or her job or abilities change.
{MClose}
13. Sound controls whether sound effects{Newline}
and music should be played in mono, stereo,{Newline}
or surround modes.
{MClose}
14. Restore Default Settings allows you{Newline}
to restore all options to their default{Newline}
values by selecting "Defaults."
{MClose}
This concludes my explanation of the game{Newline}
options.{Newline}
{Newline}
Try to find the settings you like best to make{Newline}
your gaming experience as comfortable as{Newline}
possible.{Newline}
With that, I shall bring this lesson to a close.

{Color 08}Meliadoul{Newline}
{Color 00}My mind reels to think such evil power{Newline}
lay concealed within this tiny crystal.{Newline}
These holy relics of the Church...I'd{Newline}
thought them no more than strangely{Newline}
colored stones.{Newline}
I knew not that they sought to work{Newline}
true miracles through them.
{MClose}
{Color 08}{Ramza}{Newline}
{Color 00}The truth was kept well guarded, from{Newline}
you and Isilud alike.{Newline}
Even Wiegraf knew naught of their true{Newline}
nature until he became a Lucavi.{Newline}
{Newline}
It is as I thought. Lord Folmarv guides{Newline}
even the High Confessor's scheming to{Newline}
their ends.
{MClose}
What is it they wish?
{MClose}
I cannot see their ends.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
If we are to judge from Riovanes, they{Newline}
possess power enough already to drive{Newline}
an army to its knees.{Newline}
Yet still they do not use it, or even{Newline}
flaunt it openly.{Newline}
{Newline}
There must be a reason, and that{Newline}
reason is our answer.
{MClose}
Surely they stay their hands for{Newline}
something.{Newline}
{Newline}
The Lucavi are cruel and wicked, and{Newline}
cannot be felled by men. Every tale and{Newline}
legend paints them the same.
{MClose}
So they do. But I have seen these{Newline}
monsters slain.{Newline}
{Newline}
They do not appear to be the undying{Newline}
demons of which the legends speak.
{MClose}
Legends are but stories, embellished{Newline}
with each new telling.{Newline}
{Newline}
Mayhap the Lucavi are no more than{Newline}
ordinary fiends.
{MClose}
Let us pray that you are right.
{MClose}
I trust the auracite to you. But I ask a{Newline}
favor in return.{Newline}
{Newline}
Take me with you. I must know what{Newline}
made my father as he is.{Newline}
{Newline}
And...there is another thing I would{Newline}
know as well.
{MClose}
What is that?
{MClose}
My father did a puzzling thing.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
He gifted the Capricorn Stone to{Newline}
Lord Dycedarg. But I cannot begin{Newline}
to fathom why.
{MClose}
He gave a Zodiac Stone to my brother?

{Color 00}Orran! What's happened!?{Newline}
{Newline}
You're bleeding!
{MClose}
{Color 08}Orran{Newline}
{Color 00}Lady Ovelia...there is something...something{Newline}
I must tell you...
{MClose}
You mustn't speak!
{MClose}
I beg you...hear my words.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
The man who murdered Duke Goltanna was{Newline}
not...not my father, Count Orlandeau.{Newline}
{Newline}
My father, he...he was framed for treason.{Newline}
He escaped from Fort Besselat with...{Newline}
{Ramza} Beoulve.{Newline}
He fights now to frustrate the High{Newline}
Confessor's plot.
{MClose}
I did not think the count a man{Newline}
who would plot at rebellion.
{MClose}
{Color 08}Gruff Voice{Newline}

{Color 00}Lady Ovelia! Are you safe?

{Color 08}First Voice{Newline}
{Color 00}Please open the door, my lady!
{MClose}
But if not your father,{Newline}
then who?
{MClose}
It—
{MClose}
{Color 08}Southern Sky Knight{Newline}
{Color 00}Princess, has he harmed you!?
{MClose}
{Color 08}Southern Sky Knight{Newline}
{Color 00}We found him! He's in here!
{MClose}
{Color 08}Delita{Newline}
{Color 00}Leave us.
{MClose}
My lord?
{MClose}
Stand up, turn, and walk out{Newline}
the door behind you!
{MClose}
B-but, Lord Commander—!
{MClose}
It was not a request.
{MClose}
As...as you command, my lord.
{MClose}
I beg you, hurt him no further!
{MClose}
This is a foolish thing you've done, Orran.
{MClose}
Traitor... You have no right{Newline}
to speak to me.
{MClose}
You act as though you did not wish for{Newline}
what I did.{Newline}
{Newline}
Look around you. Do you see any earnest{Newline}
tears? You were not alone in praying for{Newline}
his fall.{Newline}
I even made your father out for dead.{Newline}
You should thank me. No one pursues{Newline}
a man known slain.
{MClose}
I am in no mood for japes!
{MClose}
Why would you do such a{Newline}
thing, Delita?
{MClose}
I told you, didn't I? I work to see{Newline}
you made a queen for true.
{MClose}
Naught you do is for true! You{Newline}
wish only to use me like the rest!
{MClose}
You do not trust me?
{MClose}
...
{MClose}
You trust me or you don't, Ovelia.{Newline}
Which is it?
{MClose}
I...I want to trust you. I do.{Newline}
But...it is not such an easy thing.
{MClose}
Return to your chambers.{Newline}
I need have words with Orran.
{MClose}
Please, do not hurt him.
{MClose}
I won't. You have my word.
{MClose}
What I meant to do is done. I only{Newline}
sought to clear my father's name.{Newline}
{Newline}
Go on. I only ask you make it{Newline}
clean and quick.
{MClose}
Stop your whimpering. I do not mean to{Newline}
kill you. That would be a waste.
{MClose}
What use could you possibly{Newline}
see in me?
{MClose}
Your loyal service.
{MClose}
Ha! Again you jape!{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
I would die before I bent my{Newline}
knee in your service!
{MClose}
No. No, you would not.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
I am going to bring down the Northern Sky.{Newline}
And when that Sky falls, the land of Ivalice{Newline}
will again be made level.{Newline}
Then I build a new kingdom for Ovelia.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
The High Confessor will face judgment{Newline}
as well, of course. I am not the Church's{Newline}
hound.
{MClose}
Are you mad?
{MClose}
You know what I do is right.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
It is undeniably so.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
A commonborn squire takes the reins{Newline}
of a knightly order, and leads a wayward{Newline}
kingdom from the midst of chaos.{Newline}
The masses yearn for a hero.{Newline}
I give them what they wish.
{MClose}
Using aught and all to{Newline}
forge your legend?
{MClose}
Is that so wrong?
{MClose}
What? Do you mean to kill me?
{MClose}
I know full well the High Confessor{Newline}
sent you to keep watch on me.{Newline}
{Newline}
Your orders are to kill me at the first{Newline}
sign of betrayal, no?
{MClose}
Do it, then. Stab me with that dagger.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
I stand before you unarmed!{Newline}
Strike me down!{Newline}
{Newline}
If you will not, then do not blame me{Newline}
for this!

{Color 08}Ovelia{Newline}
{Color 00}Orran! What's happened!?{Newline}
{Newline}
You're bleeding!
{MClose}
{Color 08}Orran{Newline}
{Color 00}Lady Ovelia...there is something...something{Newline}
I must tell you...
{MClose}
You mustn't speak!
{MClose}
I beg you...hear my words.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
The man who murdered Duke Goltanna was{Newline}
not...not my father, Count Orlandeau.{Newline}
{Newline}
My father, he...he was framed for treason.{Newline}
He escaped from Fort Besselat with...{Newline}
{Ramza} Beoulve.{Newline}
He fights now to frustrate the High{Newline}
Confessor's plot.
{MClose}
I did not think the count a man{Newline}
who would plot at rebellion.
{MClose}
{Color 08}Gruff Voice{Newline}
{Color 00}The door won't open!

{Color 00}Lady Ovelia! Are you safe?
{MClose}
{Color 08}First Voice{Newline}
{Color 00}Please open the door, my lady!
{MClose}
But if not your father,{Newline}
then who?
{MClose}
It—
{MClose}
{Color 08}Southern Sky Knight{Newline}
{Color 00}Princess, has he harmed you!?
{MClose}
{Color 08}Southern Sky Knight{Newline}
{Color 00}We found him! He's in here!
{MClose}
{Color 08}Delita{Newline}
{Color 00}Leave us.
{MClose}
My lord?
{MClose}
Stand up, turn, and walk out{Newline}
the door behind you!
{MClose}
B-but, Lord Commander—!
{MClose}
It was not a request.
{MClose}
As...as you command, my lord.
{MClose}
I beg you, hurt him no further!
{MClose}
This is a foolish thing you've done, Orran.
{MClose}
Traitor... You have no right{Newline}
to speak to me.
{MClose}
You act as though you did not wish for{Newline}
what I did.{Newline}
{Newline}
Look around you. Do you see any earnest{Newline}
tears? You were not alone in praying for{Newline}
his fall.{Newline}
I even made your father out for dead.{Newline}
You should thank me. No one pursues{Newline}
a man known slain.
{MClose}
I am in no mood for japes!
{MClose}
Why would you do such a{Newline}
thing, Delita?
{MClose}
I told you, didn't I? I work to see{Newline}
you made a queen for true.
{MClose}
Naught you do is for true! You{Newline}
wish only to use me like the rest!
{MClose}
You do not trust me?
{MClose}
...
{MClose}
You trust me or you don't, Ovelia.{Newline}
Which is it?
{MClose}
I...I want to trust you. I do.{Newline}
But...it is not such an easy thing.
{MClose}
Return to your chambers.{Newline}
I need have words with Orran.
{MClose}
Please, do not hurt him.
{MClose}
I won't. You have my word.
{MClose}
What I meant to do is done. I only{Newline}
sought to clear my father's name.{Newline}
{Newline}
Go on. I only ask you make it{Newline}
clean and quick.
{MClose}
Stop your whimpering. I do not mean to{Newline}
kill you. That would be a waste.
{MClose}
What use could you possibly{Newline}
see in me?
{MClose}
Your loyal service.
{MClose}
Ha! Again you jape!{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
I would die before I bent my{Newline}
knee in your service!
{MClose}
No. No, you would not.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
I am going to bring down the Northern Sky.{Newline}
And when that Sky falls, the land of Ivalice{Newline}
will again be made level.{Newline}
Then I build a new kingdom for Ovelia.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
The High Confessor will face judgment{Newline}
as well, of course. I am not the Church's{Newline}
hound.
{MClose}
Are you mad?
{MClose}
You know what I do is right.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
It is undeniably so.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
A commonborn squire takes the reins{Newline}
of a knightly order, and leads a wayward{Newline}
kingdom from the midst of chaos.{Newline}
The masses yearn for a hero.{Newline}
I give them what they wish.
{MClose}
Using aught and all to{Newline}
forge your legend?
{MClose}
Is that so wrong?
{MClose}
What? Do you mean to kill me?
{MClose}
I know full well the High Confessor{Newline}
sent you to keep watch on me.{Newline}
{Newline}
Your orders are to kill me at the first{Newline}
sign of betrayal, no?
{MClose}
Do it, then. Stab me with that dagger.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
I stand before you unarmed!{Newline}
Strike me down!{Newline}
{Newline}
If you will not, then do not blame me{Newline}
for this!

{Color 00}{Ramza}, at last we meet!{Newline}
{Newline}
Pray forgive me. I ought to have called{Newline}
upon you sooner, but I have been ever{Newline}
so busy of late.{Newline}
I fear I remain so even now, so let us{Newline}
make this brief.{Newline}
{Newline}
If you would see your sister returned{Newline}
alive, you will relinquish the Scriptures{Newline}
and all the auracite you possess.{Newline}
Refuse, and she dies ere the word{Newline}
leaves your lips.{Newline}
{Newline}
Are we of an understanding?{Newline}
My patience is grown thin.
{MClose}
I have what you desire.{Newline}
Where is Alma?{Newline}
{Newline}
I surrender naught until{Newline}
she is brought before me.
{MClose}
Did you not hear a word I said?{Newline}
I offered no negotiable terms.{Newline}
{Newline}
Forfeit the Scriptures and the Stones,{Newline}
or forfeit your sister's life.
{MClose}
Here are the Scriptures. The Stones{Newline}
I hold until I see that she is safe.
{MClose}
Well...?
{MClose}
{Color 08}Loffrey{Newline}
{Color 00}...It is written here. A surprisingly{Newline}
simple incantation.
{MClose}
Excellent. Then we have all we need of{Newline}
them.{Newline}
{Newline}
Of course, I suppose propriety dictates{Newline}
that we venge Belias and the others{Newline}
while they're here.
{MClose}
{Color 08}{Ramza}{Newline}
{Color 00}We are deceived!
{MClose}
{Color 08}Meliadoul{Newline}
{Color 00}Are you truly the father{Newline}
I've always known?
{MClose}
{Color 08}Folmarv{Newline}
{Color 00}Of course I am, child!{Newline}
{Newline}
Why do you fight on their side?{Newline}
When did you turn against your{Newline}
own kin?
{MClose}
When my own kin ceased to be{Newline}
the man he once was.
{MClose}
Whatever do you mean?
{MClose}
The marquis Elmdore de Limberry{Newline}
was made some sort of fiend when{Newline}
he used a Zodiac Stone.{Newline}
And at Riovanes—the monster who{Newline}
killed Isilud and all the others was you,{Newline}
wasn't it?
{MClose}
Monster? You think us monsters!?
{MClose}
Then it's true! You are{Newline}
not my father.
{MClose}
{Color 08}{Ramza}{Newline}
{Color 00}Why did you not kill Alma?
{MClose}
{Color 08}Folmarv{Newline}
{Color 00}What do you mean?
{MClose}
You took no pause in slaughtering{Newline}
your own son. Why keep my sister{Newline}
alive?
{MClose}
Our affairs are not for you to know!
{MClose}
{Color 08}Folmarv{Newline}
{Color 00}Hmph. We will serve our{Newline}
vengeance another day.
{MClose}
{Color 08}{Ramza}{Newline}
{Color 00}They are even more craven{Newline}
than I'd thought!

Aye, that it does. Treasure beyond worth—{Newline}
down in the depths, out of sight and reach.

It's bound to be guarded by traps, no? Else{Newline}
it would sleep in some noble's vaults by now.

More than traps—a wizard, if talk be true.{Newline}
Soul as dark as the caverns he calls home...

Milleuda...pray forgive me.{Newline}
{Newline}
I thought to deliver swift vengeance, yet here{Newline}
I am before you, my own blade sheathed beside{Newline}
me as yours lies sheathed within the earth.{Newline}
I have failed at much, but I shall not fail you.{Newline}
Your killers will know vengeance! In this, at{Newline}
least, I shall not be disgraced.

Put aside your sword.
{MClose}
I've no wish to cross blades with the{Newline}
leader of the Corpse Brigade, even{Newline}
if the Brigade itself is no more.{Newline}
...My apologies. My words salt wounds{Newline}
still fresh, and that was not my intent.{Newline}
Your men died valiantly.
{MClose}
Make your purpose plain!
{MClose}
My name is Loffrey, and I come at{Newline}
another's behest.{Newline}
{Newline}
My purpose is a simple one: to find you.{Newline}
We'd hoped you might be persuaded to{Newline}
work with us toward our common goal.
{MClose}
Common goal? Ha! What jest, this?{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
Claiming the bounty on my head is{Newline}
no goal of mine! But that is what{Newline}
you seek, am I not mistaken?
{MClose}
{Color 08}Loffrey{Color 00}{Newline}
Pardon my presumption, but I do not think the{Newline}
tears upon your cheek those born of laughter.
{MClose}
...
{MClose}
It is not coin that we desire.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
It is our wish to rebuild Ivalice—to uproot{Newline}
her foundations, and see that she is not{Newline}
twice made slave to nobility.{Newline}
And that -is- what you seek, is it not?
{MClose}
You have my ears.
{MClose}
Our ideals are not so very different.{Newline}
A fire burns in you, as it burns in us.{Newline}
{Newline}
Your strength, your passion—your spirit!{Newline}
We would welcome these to our cause.
{MClose}
You mean to use me.
{MClose}
To every coin there are two faces.{Newline}
Do you not consider the other?{Newline}
{Newline}
Join us, and our power becomes yours{Newline}
to wield.{Newline}
{Newline}
Have you, alone, the strength to venge{Newline}
Milleuda? Have you, alone, the power to{Newline}
grasp the reins of Ivalice?

The Church's treasure—it is not the prize{Newline}

I'll certainly not object!

{Color 08}Balthier{Color 00}{Newline}

{Color 08}Balthier{Color 00}{Newline}
Such a warm welcome. I see my{Newline}
reputation precedes me.
{MClose}

You are branded a heretic as well?
{MClose}
Religion and I don't mix, I'm afraid.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
*sigh*{Newline}
Another false lead.
{MClose}
Why do you seek this...Cache of Glabados?
{MClose}
Women, treasure—does a man need{Newline}
reason to pursue beauty?
{MClose}
The Church's treasure—it is not the prize{Newline}
you think it.
{MClose}
Then you know it?
{MClose}
No, it's only—you're better off not{Newline}
searching. The road is fraught with{Newline}
dangers you cannot know.
{MClose}
Who do you think you're talking to? The{Newline}
leading man never balks at a little danger.
{MClose}
Though this does have more the feel of a{Newline}
cameo role...{Newline}
{Newline}
Nonetheless, I have my reasons for seeking{Newline}
that particular treasure.{Newline}
{Newline}
I found it once—laid my hands on it, and look{Newline}
where it's gotten me. If I find it again, I can{Newline}
put things back as they were.{Newline}
And since you seem to know something of{Newline}
it, you've gained yourself another traveling{Newline}
companion.
{MClose}
Oh?
{MClose}
Not to worry. I've some experience in the{Newline}
chaperoning of children.
{MClose}
I'm no child!
{MClose}
Yes, they all say that, don't they?
{MClose}
And -you- say you are a sky pirate.{Newline}
Would you have me believe you can fly?{Newline}
{Newline}
I see no wings.
{MClose}
I seem to always find myself a pirate without{Newline}
a sky. At this rate, I'm like to forget how to{Newline}
fly altogether.

I've been searching for them{Newline}

{Newline}
I don't suppose I could travel{Newline}

{Newline}
I mean, it's fine if you don't{Newline}

{MClose}
By all means!
{MClose}

{MClose}
Thanks, I owe you one.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
If you hadn't come along, I'd be{Newline}
making the rounds through that{Newline}
thing's innards.{Newline}
The name's Luso. I'm a game{Newline}
hunter, if you'll believe it. And{Newline}
you?
{MClose}
I am {Ramza}.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
Are you not rather young to be{Newline}
a hunter?
{MClose}
Well, times are tough. It's a good{Newline}
life, though, all in all.{Newline}
{Newline}
Sure, I run into a little trouble{Newline}
every now and again, but so far{Newline}
so good!
{MClose}
You travel alone?
{MClose}
I didn't used to. I sort of...got{Newline}
separated from my friends.{Newline}
{Newline}
I've been searching for them{Newline}
as I travel, but...no such luck.{Newline}
{Newline}
I don't suppose I could travel{Newline}
with you for a while?{Newline}
{Newline}
I mean, it's fine if you don't{Newline}
want me along.
{MClose}
By all means!
{MClose}
Great! Then it's set!
{MClose}
Is that a journal?
{MClose}
A travelogue of sorts.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
I keep a record of everything{Newline}
that happens on my journeys.
{MClose}
Planning to become a{Newline}
writer someday?
{MClose}
Heh. Something like that.
{MClose}
Shall we be on our way, then?{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
This desert sun is roasting me. I'd hate{Newline}
to escape the dinner plate only to end{Newline}

{Color 08}{Ramza}{Color 00}{Newline}
And who might you be?
{MClose}
{Color 08}Man{Color 00}{Newline}
My name is Cletienne.{Newline}
{Newline}
I come in Lord Folmarv's stead,{Newline}
to see his will made manifest.
{MClose}
A knight of the templarate, then!{Newline}
Where is Alma!?
{MClose}
My...my limbs are frozen!{Newline}
What foul trick is this!?
{MClose}
{Color 08}Cletienne{Color 00}{Newline}
A time magick of my own fabrication, its might{Newline}
all but wasted on one such as you.{Newline}
I thought myself overcautious in readying a{Newline}
trap, but it appears that was not the case.{Newline}
{Newline}
You'll find no avail in a struggle. You've not{Newline}
the strength of will to break free.{Newline}
{Newline}
Make your peace. You go to the gods.
{MClose}
What!?
{MClose}
{Color 08}Woman's Voice{Color 00}{Newline}
Ser Cletienne. How long has it{Newline}
been since last we met?
{MClose}
Yours is an unexpected sight. Tell me,{Newline}
when did you don the traitor's cloak?
{MClose}
{Color 08}Meliadoul{Color 00}{Newline}
I was not aware I had. Is not that garment{Newline}
draped about your own shoulders?{Newline}
It is Isilud and I who were used, by you{Newline}
and all the others!
{MClose}
What of it, if you were?
{MClose}
Those sins will be atoned for. There shall{Newline}
be no mercy—not even for you.
{MClose}
{Color 08}Meliadoul{Color 00}{Newline}
Know you the Stones' secret—what it{Newline}
is my father means to do?
{MClose}
{Color 08}Cletienne{Color 00}{Newline}
He strives towards a grand and lofty goal.{Newline}
Of it, I will say no more.{Newline}
Such things exceed your feeble capacity{Newline}
for understanding.
{MClose}
You know the truth, and yet you{Newline}
aid him!?{Newline}
{Newline}
But...but why?
{MClose}
*chuckle* My reasons,{Newline}
you've no need to know.
{MClose}
{Color 08}Meliadoul{Color 00}{Newline}
Isilud...forgive me...
{MClose}
{Color 08}Cletienne{Color 00}{Newline}
This I did not foresee.{Newline}
{Newline}
But surely the time I've bought{Newline}
will suffice.
{MClose}
{Color 08}Meliadoul{Color 00}{Newline}
Ser Cletienne, wait!{Newline}
{Newline}
Is...is it true? Is my father...a{Newline}
Lucavi?
{MClose}
You've eyes, have you not?{Newline}
Go and see for yourself.
{MClose}
Could he...truly be?

My lady.
{MClose}
{Color 08}Ovelia{Color 00}{Newline}
Agrias!?
{MClose}
{Color 08}Agrias{Color 00}{Newline}
Pray forgive the late hour of our coming.
{MClose}
Oh, Agrias! Gods be praised,{Newline}
you're alive!{Newline}
{Newline}
I'd no way of reaching you,{Newline}
and I'd feared the worst.{Newline}
{Newline}
Such a weight is lifted!{Newline}
Please, rise.
{MClose}
Forgive me. I gave cause for{Newline}
needless worry.{Newline}
{Newline}
Ser {Ramza} aided me.{Newline}
I travel with him even now.
{MClose}
Then I owe {Ramza} a{Newline}
great debt of gratitude.
{MClose}
You'll return to me now, won't you,{Newline}
Agrias? I need your sword and shield{Newline}
now more than ever.{Newline}
Your counsel I sorely miss as well.{Newline}
Please, Agrias, you will stay, yes?
{MClose}
My apologies, Your Majesty. I cannot tarry{Newline}
here, though it pains me to leave.{Newline}
{Newline}
There are nefarious forces afoot, who would{Newline}
take the helm of Ivalice and steer her to the{Newline}
doom of all.{Newline}
A darkness falls upon the realm, my lady,{Newline}
and it is but a matter of time before we are{Newline}
consumed by it.{Newline}
To turn a blind eye to this is to forsake the{Newline}
hallowed oath I swore: to defend this{Newline}
kingdom at peril of my life.{Newline}
My sword is sworn to you as well, and I{Newline}
mean for it to serve. Your safety requires{Newline}
that this plot be stopped.{Newline}
It is not lightly that I abandon duty, but only{Newline}
for the love I bear you and our kingdom.{Newline}
I can but pray that you forgive me, Highness.
{MClose}
I...I see.{Newline}
But—
{MClose}
{Color 08}Delita's Voice{Color 00}{Newline}
You're fond of this place,{Newline}
aren't you, Ovelia?
{MClose}
Delita...
{MClose}
{Color 08}Delita{Color 00}{Newline}
Well met. Agrias, was it not?{Newline}
{MClose}
Unmannered dog!{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
How dare you address Her Majesty{Newline}
by name!?
{MClose}
Agrias, it's all right.
{MClose}
But, my lady—!
{MClose}
It's fine. Pay it no heed.
{MClose}
If that is Your Majesty's wish...
{MClose}
Would that I had not to beg favors of such as{Newline}
you, but fate is not so kind.{Newline}
{Newline}
Responsibility for the well-being of Her Majesty{Newline}
the Princess rests in my hands. But at present,{Newline}
my hands toil toward another purpose.{Newline}
It is not without reluctance that I put my faith{Newline}
in you, but the choice is made for me. Please,{Newline}
let no harm come to Lady Ovelia!
{MClose}
Put your mind at ease. I will keep{Newline}
her safe.
{MClose}
I shall trust your words.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
Should aught befall Her Highness,{Newline}
know that my vengeance, and your{Newline}
death, will be swift.
{MClose}
Agrias!
{MClose}
My lady.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
I want you to carry this, though{Newline}
I hope with all my heart you need{Newline}
not use it.
{MClose}
Having a knife for protection{Newline}
may not be a bad idea.
{MClose}
Thank you, Agrias.
{MClose}
And now, I must take my leave.
{MClose}
Father watch over you.
{MClose}
I promise this: When all is done, I shall{Newline}
return to you.{Newline}
{Newline}
Until such time, pray be safe.
{MClose}
I shall await your return.
{MClose}
Fare-well, Majesty. And gods be with you.
{MClose}
Lavian, Alicia! With me!

{Color 08}Familiar Voice{Color 00}{Newline}
My lady.
{MClose}
{Color 08}Ovelia{Color 00}{Newline}
Agrias!?
{MClose}
{Color 08}Agrias{Color 00}{Newline}
Pray forgive the late hour of our coming.
{MClose}
Oh, Agrias! Gods be praised,{Newline}
you're alive!{Newline}
{Newline}
I'd no way of reaching you,{Newline}
and I'd feared the worst.{Newline}
{Newline}
Such a weight is lifted!{Newline}
Please, rise.
{MClose}
Forgive me. I gave cause for{Newline}
needless worry.{Newline}
{Newline}
Ser {Ramza} aided me.{Newline}
I travel with him even now.
{MClose}
Then I owe {Ramza} a{Newline}
great debt of gratitude.
{MClose}
You'll return to me now, won't you,{Newline}
Agrias? I need your sword and shield{Newline}
now more than ever.{Newline}
Your counsel I sorely miss as well.{Newline}
Please, Agrias, you will stay, yes?
{MClose}
My apologies, Your Majesty. I cannot tarry{Newline}
here, though it pains me to leave.{Newline}
{Newline}
There are nefarious forces afoot, who would{Newline}
take the helm of Ivalice and steer her to the{Newline}
doom of all.{Newline}
A darkness falls upon the realm, my lady,{Newline}
and it is but a matter of time before we are{Newline}
consumed by it.{Newline}
To turn a blind eye to this is to forsake the{Newline}
hallowed oath I swore: to defend this{Newline}
kingdom at peril of my life.{Newline}
My sword is sworn to you as well, and I{Newline}
mean for it to serve. Your safety requires{Newline}
that this plot be stopped.{Newline}
It is not lightly that I abandon duty, but only{Newline}
for the love I bear you and our kingdom.{Newline}
I can but pray that you forgive me, Highness.
{MClose}
I...I see.{Newline}
But—
{MClose}
{Color 08}Delita's Voice{Color 00}{Newline}
You're fond of this place,{Newline}
aren't you, Ovelia?
{MClose}
Delita...
{MClose}
{Color 08}Delita{Color 00}{Newline}
Well met. Agrias, was it not?{Newline}
{MClose}
Unmannered dog!{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
How dare you address Her Majesty{Newline}
by name!?
{MClose}
Agrias, it's all right.
{MClose}
But, my lady—!
{MClose}
It's fine. Pay it no heed.
{MClose}
If that is Your Majesty's wish...
{MClose}
Would that I had not to beg favors of such as{Newline}
you, but fate is not so kind.{Newline}
{Newline}
Responsibility for the well-being of Her Majesty{Newline}
the Princess rests in my hands. But at present,{Newline}
my hands toil toward another purpose.{Newline}
It is not without reluctance that I put my faith{Newline}
in you, but the choice is made for me. Please,{Newline}
let no harm come to Lady Ovelia!
{MClose}
Put your mind at ease. I will keep{Newline}
her safe.
{MClose}
I shall trust your words.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
Should aught befall Her Highness,{Newline}
know that my vengeance, and your{Newline}
death, will be swift.
{MClose}
Agrias!
{MClose}
My lady.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
I want you to carry this, though{Newline}
I hope with all my heart you need{Newline}
not use it.
{MClose}
Having a knife for protection{Newline}
may not be a bad idea.
{MClose}
Thank you, Agrias.
{MClose}
And now, I must take my leave.
{MClose}
Father watch over you.
{MClose}
I promise this: When all is done, I shall{Newline}
return to you.{Newline}
{Newline}
Until such time, pray be safe.
{MClose}
I shall await your return.
{MClose}
Fare-well, Majesty. And gods be with you.
{MClose}
Lavian, Alicia! With me!

{Color 08}Reis{Color 00}{Newline}
The fields of Lionel unfold on the horizon—{Newline}
the grass and soil of our homeland.
{MClose}
Forgive me, Beowulf. For me, you've{Newline}
forfeited so much. You now even bear{Newline}
the heretic's brand.{Newline}
We cannot return home.
{MClose}
There's naught to forgive. 'Twas Bremondt{Newline}
whose deeds were ill, and those I am not{Newline}
of a mind to pardon.{Newline}
I've grown accustomed to this vagrant life.{Newline}
It is not Lionel's fields I love. So long as you{Newline}
are with me, Reis, I am home.
{MClose}
My love...
{MClose}
We're like to be departing soon.{Newline}
I had best go and see if my help{Newline}
is needed.
{MClose}
{Color 08}Reis{Color 00}{Newline}
What do you—?{Newline}
Release me!
{MClose}
Reis!
{MClose}
Ser Aliste!
{MClose}
{Color 08}Aliste{Color 00}{Newline}
We meet again, Beowulf.{Newline}
{Newline}
I know not how you managed to free Reis{Newline}
of her curse, but Celebrant Bremondt bids{Newline}
me extend his deepest gratitude.
{MClose}
Where is she? What have you done with{Newline}
her!?
{MClose}
Come now, there's no need to lose your{Newline}
composure. The girl sleeps peacefully.{Newline}
{Newline}
And when she awakens, she'll be safely{Newline}
within the keep of Lionel Castle, where{Newline}
Celebrant Bremondt awaits her.
{MClose}
Return her at once, ere I draw my blade!
{MClose}
Are you sure you wish to do that? My men are{Newline}
loyal, yes, but I cannot say what they might do{Newline}
to your sweet Reis should I fail to return.{Newline}
If you would have her back, you'd best make{Newline}
for the castle.
{MClose}
Ser Aliste, wait!{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
What has become of you? You were{Newline}
once my ally, and hers! Why now this?
{MClose}
You know nothing, Beowulf.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
Have you no knowledge of the bounty{Newline}
on your own head? 'Tis sum enough to{Newline}
make a man forget allegiance.{Newline}
Add Bremondt's reward to that, and{Newline}
you've one enough to make a man{Newline}
forsake it altogether!
{MClose}
I shall guarantee Reis's safety until such{Newline}
time as you arrive. If harm should befall{Newline}
her, we lose our only hold on you.{Newline}
In the meantime, take care to guard your{Newline}
own neck. That head of yours is worth{Newline}
more than most men can even dream of.
{MClose}
Reis...wait for me.

What!?
{MClose}
There's more. A great number of our{Newline}
troops have fallen comatose. We know{Newline}
not why.{Newline}
We fear them drugged.
{MClose}
Im...impossible! Who—?
{MClose}
Our remaining numbers engage the enemy{Newline}

{Color 08}Celebrant Bremondt{Color 00}{Newline}
N-no! That's...that's not true!{Newline}
Reis is but deceived!{Newline}
It is you...your lies that blind her{Newline}
heart! When you are gone, it will all{Newline}

me, though she knew what it might entail.{Newline}

something you will never know.

"Yield," the boy says!

Beg pardons, milord. I'm afraid we're{Newline}

have this?
{MClose}
Of course! Why do you ask?

It cost a goodly amount, did it not?{Newline}

a knight such as I?

No, not at all!{Newline}
Please, accept it!
