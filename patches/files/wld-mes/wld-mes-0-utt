{LS}Brigandry is on the rise across the land, and Gallionne{Newline}
has by no means been spared. Wains are struck and pillaged,{Newline}
high-ranking officials taken at swordpoint. Most of the{Newline}
incidents of this past six-month are believed to be the{Newline}
work of a company of felons and former sellswords known{Newline}
as the Corpse Brigade.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
{LS}It is oft said the only good brigand is a dead brigand,{Newline}
and the Order of the Northern Sky would like naught more{Newline}
than to see the Brigade made corpses for true. But as{Newline}
yet, it is all the knighthood can do to keep the outlaws in{Newline}
check.

{0xF566}{0xF660}{0xF508}{0xF601}{0xF566}{0xF660}{0xF509}{0xF601}{LS}The health of King Ondoria III has been a subject of{Newline}
concern since his collapse at the birthday celebration of{Newline}
Prince Orinus. The Board of Chamberlains has since{Newline}
announced that the king has regained consciousness and{Newline}
his fever has broken, but will yet require several weeks{Newline}
of quietude and bed rest in order to recover.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
{LS}Many speculate that it may be some months before the{Newline}
king resumes his official duties. However, Queen Louveria{Newline}
and her retainers have long been in charge of most affairs{Newline}
of state, and thus few problems are anticipated during the{Newline}
king's absence.
{MClose}
{LS}The half-century of conflict between Ivalice and{Newline}
Ordallia is today known as the Fifty Years' War.{Newline}
{LS}The beginning of the Fifty Years' War can be traced to{Newline}
the death of Ordallia's King Devanne III, and his failure to{Newline}
name a successor. His cousin, Varoi VI, was next in line{Newline}
for the throne; however, King Denamda II of Ivalice (the{Newline}
uncle of Devanne III) proclaimed himself the rightful heir{Newline}
and declared war on Ordallia.{Newline}
{LS}However, this was merely a pretense to justify the{Newline}
invasion of the neighboring Ordallian province of Zelmonia.{Newline}
Once an independent state, it had been annexed by Ordallia{Newline}
nearly a century prior. Ivalice had since been aiding the{Newline}
province in an effort to weaken Ordallia—an effort that{Newline}
ultimately failed. Tired of Ordallian rule, the Zelmonian{Newline}
leadership and nobility secretly petitioned Ivalice to take{Newline}
a more direct hand in their liberation.{Newline}
{LS}After a victory in Zelmonia, the Ivalician armies{Newline}
marched on the Ordallian capital of Viura. As fate would{Newline}
have it, Denamda II succumbed to fatal illness on the{Newline}
road. The momentary confusion amongst Ivalice's troops{Newline}
gave Ordallia the opportunity it needed to regroup, and{Newline}
Varoi VI succeeded in pushing the Ivalicians back as far{Newline}
as Zelmonia. The resulting impasse would not be broken{Newline}
until the Romandan army's invasion two years hence.{Newline}
{LS}Romanda, a powerful military state lying across the{Newline}
Rhana Strait, marched on Ivalice at the behest of Varoi{Newline}
VI, a blood relation of the Romandan nobility. However,{Newline}
Denamda II's successor Denamda IV was a fearless{Newline}
warrior, personally leading his men into battle against{Newline}
the combined might of Romanda and Ordallia. This, along{Newline}
with an outbreak of the Black Death in Romanda, forced{Newline}
the Romandan army to withdraw after only three years.{Newline}
{LS}Two military orders worthy of particular mention in{Newline}
this conflict are the Order of the Northern Sky, led by{Newline}
Knight Gallant Barbaneth Beoulve, and that of the{Newline}
Southern Sky, led by Cidolfus Orlandeau, known also as{Newline}
the Thunder God.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
{LS}After countless victories at home, these two orders{Newline}
had been poised to advance into Ordallia. However, the{Newline}
protracted conflict had begun to take its toll on domestic{Newline}
morale. Peasant uprisings and revolts throughout Ivalice{Newline}
and Ordallia forced both countries to send their troops{Newline}
home to pacify their own citizens, resulting in another{Newline}
stalemate.{Newline}
{Newline}
{LS}It was Denamda IV's sudden death by malady that broke{Newline}
the stalemate, although some claim that he was murdered.{Newline}
His successor, Ondoria III, was ill suited to the throne,{Newline}
and left the governing of Ivalice to his queen and retainers.{Newline}
Without Denamda IV's leadership, the armies of Ivalice had{Newline}
little prayer of preventing Varoi VI's successor, Prince{Newline}
Lennard, from defeating the troops stationed in Zelmonia{Newline}
and advancing into Ivalice proper.{Newline}
{LS}Despite the valiant efforts of the Northern and{Newline}
Southern Orders, Ivalice failed to repel Prince Lennard's{Newline}
invasion of Zeltennia. Ivalice's leaders soon began looking{Newline}
for a peaceful alternative. In the end, both states agreed{Newline}
that prolonging the war would prove mutually detrimental,{Newline}
and a pact was signed allowing each nation to return to{Newline}
addressing domestic strife. An equal peace in name, it was{Newline}
in reality a defeat for Ivalice.{Newline}
{LS}The economy of Ivalice was brought to the very brink{Newline}
of ruin as it struggled to pay reparations to its former{Newline}
enemies and to repay the loans taken from neighboring{Newline}
states to fund its war effort. Soldiers returning from{Newline}
the front found themselves without pay, and entire orders{Newline}
of knights were summarily discharged from service. The{Newline}
swelling ranks of the unemployed did little to relieve the{Newline}
people's distrust of the Crown and the nobility.
{MClose}
{LS}The capital is rife with rumors that King Ondoria III's{Newline}
condition has taken a sudden turn for the worse. Although{Newline}
official word is that he has been steadily improving since{Newline}
his collapse at Prince Orinus's birthday celebration, the{Newline}
looks on the faces of his aides tell a different story. If{Newline}
the king should pass without naming a regent for the{Newline}
young prince, a battle over succession between the{Newline}
Council and the Crown seems inevitable.
{MClose}
{LS}The Corpse Brigade, the worst band of outlaws to{Newline}
terrorize Gallionne in recent memory, has been defeated{Newline}
thanks to the combined efforts of the four great knightly{Newline}
orders, led by the Order of the Northern Sky. It is said{Newline}
that some seven hundred of the brigands have been{Newline}
captured and more than three thousand killed in the{Newline}
campaign to bring the Corpse Brigade to justice.{Newline}
{Newline}
{LS}The Brigade's leader, Wiegraf Folles, has yet to be{Newline}
captured, but a representative of the Northern Order has{Newline}
sworn that it is merely a matter of time before Folles is{Newline}
brought to justice.
{MClose}
{LS}While the Corpse Brigade has been vanquished, their{Newline}
leader Wiegraf Folles continues to evade justice. And even{Newline}
as the Order of the Northern Sky worked to round up the{Newline}
last of the Brigade, former Brigade members led an attack{Newline}
on the manse of the esteemed House Beoulve at Eagrose.{Newline}
Their target is said to have been none other than Duke{Newline}
Larg's advisor, Lord Dycedarg Beoulve. Fortunately, the{Newline}
attempt was thwarted.
{MClose}
{LS}Since the death of King Ondoria III, Queen Louveria's{Newline}
campaign to seize total control of the government has{Newline}
proceeded apace. All who oppose her—even members of the{Newline}
Council—are mercilessly stripped of their rank. Even the{Newline}
queen mother, who had openly criticized the actions of her{Newline}
son's wife, was banished to Bunahan, never to return. Her{Newline}
fate is unknown, although some say she was poisoned.
{MClose}
{LS}Duke Larg, trueborn brother of Queen Louveria, and{Newline}
Duke Goltanna, cousin of the late king, are locked in a{Newline}
fierce political struggle for control of Ivalice. Both men{Newline}
hope to be appointed guardian of Prince Orinus and thus{Newline}
gain the title and authority of regent. Although the queen{Newline}
supports Duke Larg, a goodly number of nobles and Council{Newline}
members appear to back Duke Goltanna, and there are{Newline}
rumors he may be officially appointed regent ere long.
{MClose}
{LS}Peasants riot throughout Duke Goltanna's province of{Newline}
Zeltennia. This sudden outbreak of civil unrest stems from{Newline}
the unanticipated loss of crops due to last year's drought,{Newline}
coupled with the burden of taxes that have been steadily{Newline}
rising since the end of the Fifty Years' War. A group of{Newline}
former knights calling itself the Order of the Ebon Eye{Newline}
appears to be fomenting the violence, even as Baron{Newline}
Grimms' Blackram Knights struggle to contain it.
{MClose}
{LS}Princess Ovelia has been kidnapped from Orbonne{Newline}
Monastery. Witnesses claim the knights responsible bore{Newline}
the crest of the Black Lion, leading many to conclude{Newline}
that it was the work of Duke Goltanna's Order of the{Newline}
Southern Sky. The duke, however, denies involvement and{Newline}
is dispatching a search party in an effort to prove his{Newline}
innocence. Given the unrest in Zeltennia, it seems doubtful{Newline}
he will be able to spare many men for the effort.
{MClose}
{LS}Long ago, before Ivalice was united as it is today, the{Newline}
land was divided into seven kingdoms: Zeltennia, Fovoham,{Newline}
Lionel, Limberry, Lesalia, Gallionne, and Mullonde. Each{Newline}
kingdom clashed with the others in an endless effort to{Newline}
expand its own territory.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
{LS}The conflict continued for centuries, until a brave and{Newline}
ambitious young king appeared in Mullonde. This king dreamt{Newline}
of uniting all of Ivalice under his hand, but such feats are{Newline}
not with ease achieved. Turning to ancient tomes and the{Newline}
dark magicks found within, he summoned a demon from the{Newline}
netherworld to do his bidding. But once unleashed, the{Newline}
demon could not be controlled. It slew the king and set out{Newline}
to destroy the world of men.{Newline}
{LS}Twelve brave warriors were gathered to slay the demon{Newline}
and the foul horrors that it had summoned. They soon{Newline}
defeated the horrors and banished the demon back to the{Newline}
netherworld. These twelve warriors each carried with{Newline}
them a crystal engraved with a sign of the zodiac, and so{Newline}
became known as the Zodiac Braves.
{MClose}
{LS}These crystals are said to date from the age of myth.{Newline}
Each bears the mark of a sign of the zodiac, leading them{Newline}
to be called the Zodiac Stones. They are thought to harbor{Newline}
divine power which allowed the Zodiac Braves to perform{Newline}
astonishing miracles. Their last appearance in historical{Newline}
records dates from the time of Saint Ajora. Since then,{Newline}
the Zodiac Stones have remained hidden from mortal sight.
{MClose}
{LS}The Baert Trading Company, a successful trading{Newline}
company based in the merchant city of Warjilis, has{Newline}
garnered the favor of the populace by donating generously{Newline}
to bridge- and road-building projects, as well as to local{Newline}
orphanages. But not all of the talk surrounding this{Newline}
company is favorable. Many say the true source of the{Newline}
trading company's wealth is of a most unsavory nature—{Newline}
opium smuggling, slave trading, and even murder most foul.
{MClose}
{LS}Three months have passed since the Battle of{Newline}
Groffovia—the first full-scale battle between the forces{Newline}
of Lesalia and Limberry on the plains that define the{Newline}
border of their two lands. Formidable knights, once allies{Newline}
in war, now meet each other as enemies on the battlefield{Newline}
in skirmishes with no clear victor—bloody clashes that{Newline}
have resulted in close to four hundred thousand casualties.{Newline}
{Newline}
{LS}Many say that the two sides have reached an impasse,{Newline}
and the prospect of a protracted struggle does little to{Newline}
bolster the already low spirits of the people.
{MClose}
{LS}Princess Ovelia, abducted from Orbonne Monastery, has{Newline}
now been rescued. To the shock of many, the culprits were{Newline}
Duke Goltanna's aide Chancellor Glevanne and, it seems,{Newline}
Queen Louveria herself. Rumor holds that the queen{Newline}
instructed the chancellor to dispose of the princess, thus{Newline}
placing her own son next in line for the throne. Chancellor{Newline}
Glevanne has been put to death for the plot, but the queen{Newline}
denies all knowledge of it.{Newline}
{LS}The young warrior who saved the princess is said to be{Newline}
a lieutenant in Baron Grimms' Blackram Knights by the{Newline}
name of Delita Heiral. In honor of his achievement, he is{Newline}
expected to be given leadership of the knights in place of{Newline}
Baron Grimms, who was killed in battle against the Order{Newline}
of the Ebon Eye.
{MClose}
{LS}It has been three months since the death of Cardinal{Newline}
Delacroix, liege lord of Lionel. Although his death has{Newline}
been attributed to malady, many speculate that he was{Newline}
assassinated. Some even say that he was slain by an{Newline}
otherworldly fiend. The violent assault on Lionel Castle{Newline}
by a band of brigands on the eve of Delacroix's death{Newline}
lends momentum to such outlandish rumors, for strangely{Newline}
enough, the slain appeared to have been crushed to death.
{MClose}
{LS}Famine the likes of which have not been seen in decades{Newline}
has descended upon Ivalice. The eastern lands of Zeltennia{Newline}
and Limberry suffer from a drought which has reduced the{Newline}
harvest to half that of a normal year. And to the west in{Newline}
Gallionne and Fovoham, widespread flooding has also{Newline}
destroyed close to half of all crops. The capital of Lesalia{Newline}
is awash with refugees who have lost their homes in the{Newline}
war, or who are simply in search of food.
{MClose}
{LS}The marquis Elmdore de Limberry, dubbed the "Silver{Newline}
Prince" by his friends and "Silver Demon" by his foes,{Newline}
was slain by a stray arrow in battle on the Fusse Plains.{Newline}
Despite his noble title, he was a popular figure amongst{Newline}
the common people and a devout member of the Church of{Newline}
Glabados. A steady stream of mourners pay respects at{Newline}
his grave. He was a steadfast general of Duke Goltanna's,{Newline}
and it seems a certainty that his death will affect the war.
{MClose}
{LS}Having apparently lost patience with the long stalemate,{Newline}
Duke Larg's troops have at last taken action. The Order{Newline}
of the Northern Sky, along with most of the soldiers on{Newline}
the front lines, have marched on Fort Besselat. Besselat{Newline}
is an indispensable strongpoint in the battle against{Newline}
Zeltennia, and capturing it would give Duke Larg's forces{Newline}
access to Limberry's abundant food supply. This battle{Newline}
could well be the key to victory.
{MClose}
{LS}Just as rumors of the otherworldly fiend that attacked{Newline}
Lionel Castle begin to die down, another is now said to{Newline}
have appeared at Riovanes—the residence of Grand Duke{Newline}
Barrington. More than five hundred men lost their lives in{Newline}
the ensuing battle. No witnesses survived and there are{Newline}
no clues as to what occurred. Those who have seen the{Newline}
aftermath say that they will never forget the scores of{Newline}
corpses, some with their heads crushed like melons.
{MClose}
{0xF566}{0xF610}{0xF506}{0xF601}
{LS}Monsters have taken up residence in one of the many{Newline}
coal mines in Gollund. The local government sent out a call{Newline}
for knights to slay the beasts, but the war has made{Newline}
finding able-bodied men difficult. Anxious to be rid of the{Newline}
monsters, the government is now offering a reward for{Newline}
any commoner who can slay them. One can only hope that{Newline}
such a hero will be found soon.
{MClose}
{0xF566}{0xF611}{0xF500}{0xF601}
{LS}The isle of Nelveska lies some eighty thousand dohms{Newline}
north of Zeltennia. The center of the island is home to the{Newline}
ruins of many ancient temples which served as a crucial{Newline}
base for the warriors fighting Ordallia's forces during the{Newline}
Fifty Years' War. Although Nelveska may appear to be a{Newline}
lush jungle paradise, the local fishermen avoid it, claiming{Newline}
that it is cursed, and a "fearsome iron sentinel" will{Newline}
slaughter any who dare approach.

{LS}Clergymen from all over Ivalice have been reporting{Newline}
thefts as of late. All of the items stolen have been jewels{Newline}
in the care of religious institutions, leading the Church of{Newline}
Glabados to conclude that the crimes are the work of{Newline}
heretics or other enemies of the Church. Anticipating{Newline}
further incidents, it has warned its members to exercise{Newline}
particular vigilance.

{LS}The city of Bervenia has donated a treasure known as{Newline}
the Wailing Orte to the city of Dorter, and a merchant has{Newline}
been commissioned to make the delivery. However, recent{Newline}
rumors of bandits on the trade routes have him too{Newline}
frightened to make the journey. He seeks guards with{Newline}
strong swordarms to protect him along his way.
{MClose}
{0xF566}{0xF64C}{0xF504}{0xF601}
{LS}The Order of the Northern Sky lost their leader, Duke{Newline}
Larg, at the battle of Fort Besselat. Their misfortune{Newline}
was followed by further tragedies: the mysterious{Newline}
disappearance of their commander Lord Zalbaag, and the{Newline}
murder of Lord Dycedarg. These events exacerbated the{Newline}
discontent already present in the Order, causing a group{Newline}
of knights to defect, taking up residence in a former{Newline}
brigands' den and terrorizing nearby towns.
{MClose}
{0xF566}{0xF64C}{0xF505}{0xF601}
{LS}Several months had passed since the murder of Cardinal{Newline}
Delacroix, and the question of who would succeed him as{Newline}
liege lord of Lionel had been on everyone's minds. Although{Newline}
a fierce struggle for power no doubt occurred behind the{Newline}
scenes, Celebrant Bremondt was chosen in the end as{Newline}
expected. He is known for his genial disposition and{Newline}
uncompromising pursuit of heretics, and most have high{Newline}
hopes for his future as Lionel's new ruler.

Ivalician legend. It came to light that Mustadio's troubles{Newline}
were also connected to the Stones, and so we set out for{Newline}

Mustadio's father Besrudio entrusted it to his son and{Newline}
beseeched him to hide it someplace safe. But just as{Newline}
Mustadio took the Stone, thugs in the employ of the Baert{Newline}
Trading Company arrived to give chase. (Press △ to{Newline}

prevented the enemy from obtaining the real Stone, and{Newline}
saved his father's life in the process. But the princess and{Newline}

compatibility. Units with opposite signs and the same{Newline}
gender have the poorest possible compatibility. Units with{Newline}
opposite signs and opposite genders, however, have{Newline}
excellent compatibility. Monsters are considered to be of{Newline}
different gender to both male and female humans, but the{Newline}

{LS}Compatibility affects both the amount of damage dealt{Newline}
to enemies and the success rate of magicks. For example,{Newline}
if a unit attacks an enemy of good compatibility with a{Newline}
weapon, it will deal 15% more damage than it normally{Newline}
would. Excellent compatibility would increase the amount{Newline}
of damage by 30%. On the other hand, damage dealt to{Newline}
enemies of poor compatibility is reduced by 15%, and of{Newline}
extremely poor compatibility, by 30%.

{LS}Charge time (CT) determines the order of units' turns{Newline}
in battle. When a unit's CT reaches 100, that unit{Newline}
receives a turn to move and act. A unit's CT is increased{Newline}
by an amount equal to its Speed with each tick of the{Newline}
game clock, so units with higher Speed will receive turns{Newline}
more frequently.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
{LS}Weapon attacks are carried out immediately upon{Newline}
selecting "Attack," but magicks and some other abilities{Newline}
take additional time to execute. A separate CT counter{Newline}
starts for these abilities as soon as the unit completes{Newline}
its turn. Once the count reaches 100, the magick or{Newline}
ability will take effect. A magick's CT is increased by{Newline}
amounts equal to the Speed of the magick itself.{Newline}
{MClose}
{LS}You will likely wish to keep a close eye on the order of{Newline}
units' turns during battle. There are several different{Newline}
ways to do so.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
1. When the cursor is on a unit, that unit's order in the{Newline}
{Tab 0B}rotation is shown just above its various attributes{Newline}
{Tab 0B}in the lower left of the screen.{Newline}
2. When selecting an ability to perform, pressing the left{Newline}
{Tab 0B}or right button will open a turn list showing when that{Newline}
{Tab 0B}ability would take effect relative to other units'{Newline}
{Tab 0B}actions.{Newline}
{Newline}
3. To view the current turn list, close any open menus,{Newline}
{Tab 0B}press △, and then select "Turn List" from the menu{Newline}
{Tab 0B}that appears. You can check the location of any unit{Newline}
{Tab 0B}on the list by moving the cursor to its number in the{Newline}
{Tab 0B}turn list and then pressing ×.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
4. You can sort units according to turn order in the unit{Newline}
{Tab 0B}list. To open the unit list, close any open menus, press{Newline}
{Tab 0B}△, and then select "Unit List" from the menu that{Newline}
{Tab 0B}appears.{Newline}
5. Pressing START when no menus are displayed will cycle{Newline}
{Tab 0B}through all units in order of their turn numbers.
{MClose}
{LS}When selecting magicks, which have a charge time{Newline}
requirement, you will see three different columns. The{Newline}
name of the magick is listed under the Ability column.{Newline}
The MP column shows the magick's MP cost. The turn on{Newline}
which the unit would finish casting the magick is{Newline}
indicated by the number in the Turn column. If a magick{Newline}
can be reflected, a curved arrow icon will be shown to the{Newline}
left of the MP cost.{Newline}
{LS}The number shown in the Turn column depends on when{Newline}
the magick is cast. If only one other unit would receive a{Newline}
turn before the magick takes effect, the number in this{Newline}
column would be a 2. If two units would have a chance to{Newline}
act, this number would be a 3. To see when in the turn{Newline}
list a magick would be cast, move the cursor to that{Newline}
magick's name and press the left or right button.
{MClose}
{LS}When selecting a target for a unit's action, the red{Newline}
tiles displayed around the unit are the tiles that may be{Newline}
targeted. You can view the effective range of weapons or{Newline}
abilities in their help messages. Most weapons have a{Newline}
range of 1, but some have greater reach. For example,{Newline}
polearms have a range of 2, and crossbows of 4.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
{LS}When an ability's help text shows a range of Self, that{Newline}
particular ability may only be executed on the unit's own{Newline}
tile. The ranges of some actions are limited vertically as{Newline}
well. If this is the case, a vertical range limit will also{Newline}
be listed as "Vert." followed by a number. A vertical range{Newline}
of 2 means the action can target a tile of up to 2 units{Newline}
of elevation above or below the current one.{Newline}
{MClose}
{LS}The radius of an ability or weapon is the measure of{Newline}
how many tiles it may affect. For example, the white{Newline}
magick Cure has a radius of 2. Thus, it will affect the{Newline}
target tile, as well as the next four neighboring tiles.{Newline}
These tiles are highlighted in green once a target is{Newline}
selected.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
{LS}The radius for weapons is always 1. Abilities, on the{Newline}
other hand, have various radiuses, which may be checked{Newline}
using the help system. If the radius shown in the help{Newline}
window has a vertical limit, it will be denoted by "Vert."{Newline}
followed by a number. If the vertical radius is 1, then it{Newline}
may reach 1 tile above or below the targeted tile.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
{LS}Some abilities do not affect every tile within their{Newline}
radius of effect, but instead hit only a random number of{Newline}
tiles. Being within an ability's radius does not guarantee{Newline}
a unit will be affected.
{MClose}
{LS}During a unit's turn, it may move once and perform a{Newline}
single action. Always consider the range of units'{Newline}
abilities before moving them. Otherwise, units may find{Newline}
themselves unable to reach the desired targets when{Newline}
casting magicks or performing other actions. Once a{Newline}
unit's movement has been confirmed, that movement{Newline}
cannot be canceled.
{MClose}
{LS}The predicted results of an action are displayed at the{Newline}
bottom of the screen when selecting a target. The{Newline}
estimated amount of damage or recovery is shown, along{Newline}
with the chance of success. If the ability in question has{Newline}
a chance of inflicting or removing a status effect, the{Newline}
name of the effect and percentage chance of infliction{Newline}
or removal will be shown. If multiple status effects are{Newline}
involved, only one of them will be displayed. {Newline}
{LS}The target's Evade Rates (Parry, C-EV, S-EV, and{Newline}
A-EV) are factored into the percentage chance of success.{Newline}
However, Evade Rates are not the only factors involved.{Newline}
Abilities that add or remove status effects have their{Newline}
own inherent chances of success. Attacking from the side{Newline}
or from behind the target can also increase the odds of{Newline}
success.{Newline}
{Newline}
{LS}When the targeted unit has been assigned a reaction{Newline}
ability, the name of that ability is also displayed under{Newline}
that unit's status information.
{MClose}
{LS}When using an ability with a charge time requirement,{Newline}
such as a magick, you must decide whether to target a{Newline}
specific unit or a tile. If a unit is targeted, that unit{Newline}
will remain targeted even if it moves to another tile. The{Newline}
area of effect moves with the unit. If a tile is targeted,{Newline}
the effect will remain centered on that tile and may miss{Newline}
the intended target or targets if they move away.
{MClose}
{LS}Arithmeticians can cast magicks targeting all units{Newline}
whose attributes fit a particular arithmetick expression.{Newline}
The following rules apply to the Arithmeticks ability:{Newline}
{Newline}
1. To use Arithmeticks, a unit must know the abilities{Newline}
{Tab 0B}for at least one targeted attribute (CT, Level, EXP,{Newline}
{Tab 0B}or Height) and one formula (Multiple of 5, Multiple of 4,{Newline}
{Tab 0B}Multiple of 3, or Prime Number).{Newline}
2. Targets on the battlefield are determined by the{Newline}
{Tab 0B}selected attribute and formula combination.{Newline}
3. Arithmeticks may be used to cast some white, black,{Newline}
{Tab 0B}and time magicks, as well as some mystic arts.{Newline}
4. Magicks cast with Arithmeticks consume no MP.{Newline}
5. Magicks cast with Arithmeticks require no charge{Newline}
{Tab 0B}time.{Newline}
{Newline}
{LS}As an example, you could select Level for the targeted{Newline}
attribute, Multiple of 5 for the formula, and the black{Newline}
magick Fire as the spell to cast, resulting in the{Newline}
expression Target Level = Multiple of 5: Fire.{Newline}
This will cause all units whose levels are multiples of 5{Newline}
to be hit with Fire.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
{LS}There are four different formulas: Multiple of 3,{Newline}
Multiple of 4, Multiple of 5, and Prime Number.{Newline}
The first three will target units whose selected{Newline}
attribute is a multiple of that number. For example,{Newline}
Multiple of 3 will target all units with values of{Newline}
3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and so on for the selected attribute.{Newline}
Prime Number, on the other hand, targets all units with{Newline}
a prime number as the value of the selected attribute.{Newline}
{LS}A prime number is a number higher than 1 that can{Newline}
be evenly divided only by 1 and itself. These are the{Newline}
prime numbers less than 100:{Newline}

{LS}Geomancy taps into the magick of the natural{Newline}
environment for use in battle. Geomancy abilities depend{Newline}
on the terrain of the tile on which the user is standing.{Newline}
View the help message of the tile to see its geomancy{Newline}
effect.
{MClose}
{LS}Some abilities may only be used when certain items are{Newline}
in the party inventory. These are the the ninja's Throw{Newline}
ability, the samurai's Iaido, and the chemist's Items.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
{LS}Simply knowing these abilities is not enough. The unit{Newline}
must also have the requisite item. For example, the{Newline}
Potion ability may only be executed when there is at least{Newline}
one potion in the party inventory. Each time the Item or{Newline}
Throw ability is used, one item in the party's possession{Newline}
will be consumed, and using Iaido will sometimes cause{Newline}
the katana to shatter.
{MClose}
{LS}If another unit or obstacle is in the line of fire when{Newline}
attacking with a bow, crossbow, or gun, the attack will{Newline}
not reach its intended target. This also applies to the{Newline}
chemist's Throw Items ability. When the probability of{Newline}
success for these actions is displayed as 0%, it most{Newline}
likely means something is in the way of the target.

{LS}The Jump attribute indicates how far a unit may jump.{Newline}
A unit may jump vertically a difference in height equal to{Newline}
its Jump attribute. However, a unit can jump only half{Newline}
that distance across a horizontal gap. These rules are{Newline}
automatically factored into your units' movement ranges.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
{LS}When jumping across a gap, the edge of the tile the{Newline}
unit is standing on must be the same height or higher{Newline}
than the edge on the other side. For example, a successful{Newline}
jump can be made over a 1-tile gap from a height of 4.5h{Newline}
to a height of 4h. However, a unit cannot jump a 1-tile{Newline}
gap from a height of 4.5h to a height of 5h. The unit{Newline}
must go to the bottom of the gap and find a way to climb{Newline}
up.

{LS}Bodies of water on the battlefield, such as rivers and{Newline}
canals, may partially submerge units. Water tiles have the{Newline}
following effects:{Newline}
- Walking is impeded, reducing movement range{Newline}
- Units cannot perform actions in water of depth 2{Newline}
- Some monsters cannot enter water
{MClose}
{LS}Weather in Ivalice can be divided into two alternating{Newline}
periods of the Dry and the Rains.{Newline}
{Newline}
{LS}Dry months: Pisces, Aries, Taurus{Newline}
{LS}Wet months: Gemini, Cancer{Newline}
{LS}Dry months: Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio{Newline}
{LS}Wet months: Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius{Newline}
{Newline}
{LS}Weather patterns have the following effects during{Newline}
battle:{Newline}
1. Elemental magicks are affected by rain.{Newline}
{Tab 0B}Fire magicks are weakened, while lightning magicks{Newline}
{Tab 0B}are strengthened.{Newline}
2. Strong rain makes it more difficult to walk in swamps.{Newline}
3. Strong rain reduces accuracy with a bow or crossbow.{Newline}
4. Ice magicks are strengthened by snow.
{MClose}
{LS}The Reflect status effect causes magicks to bounce off{Newline}
the affected unit and strike a different tile. The tile hit{Newline}
is symmetric to the position of the caster and the{Newline}
original target. For example, if the caster was two tiles{Newline}
down and one tile left from the original target, the{Newline}
reflected magick will strike the tile two tiles up and one{Newline}
tile right from the original target.{Newline}
{Newline}

{LS}Tiles on the battlefield are sometimes armed with{Newline}
traps. Moving to such a tile will trigger the trap, causing{Newline}
one of the following effects:{Newline}
{Newline}
{LS}Sten Needle Trap: HP loss{Newline}
{LS}Hypnogas Trap: Sleep{Newline}
{LS}Death Trap: Doom{Newline}
{LS}Degenerator: Level loss (-1)
{MClose}
{LS}When a tile on the battlefield is armed with a trap, it{Newline}
is often for the purpose of protecting an item hidden on{Newline}
that tile. If you move a human unit onto that tile, they{Newline}
can evade the trap and claim the hidden item. However,{Newline}
the trap will remain on the tile until sprung, even after{Newline}
the item has been found.
{MClose}
{LS}Once a unit has been KO'd, a countdown begins. If the{Newline}
unit is not revived before the count reaches zero, the{Newline}
unit will transform into a crystal and lost forever.{Newline}
{Newline}
{LS}When the unit becomes a crystal, its equipment will be{Newline}
returned to the party inventory. Stepping onto the crystal{Newline}
may allow you to acquire some of the unit's learned abilities.{Newline}
{Newline}
{LS}When an enemy unit's count reaches zero, they will{Newline}
transform into either a crystal or a treasure chest. If the{Newline}
unit becomes a treasure chest, one of the unit's items will{Newline}
be placed within the chest on the battlefield. Stepping onto{Newline}
the treasure chest allows you to collect the item.
{MClose}
{LS}A unit's Faith indicates the level of his or her belief{Newline}
in the divine. The higher this value, the more profound{Newline}
the unit's belief and understanding of phenomena beyond{Newline}
the mundane.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
Faith affects the following:{Newline}
1. The potency of offensive magicks{Newline}
2. The potency of recovery magicks{Newline}
3. The success rate of magicks that cause or remove{Newline}
{Tab 0B}status effects{Newline}

{Newline}
{LS}To learn how the various status effects can be{Newline}
removed, check the help messages for abilities, items,{Newline}
and the status effects themselves.
{MClose}
{LS}When a unit is KO'd, a countdown begins. The speed of{Newline}
the countdown depends upon the KO'd unit's Speed{Newline}
attribute. When the count reaches zero, the unit dies and{Newline}
a crystal or treasure chest appear in its place. It is{Newline}
impossible to resurrect a unit once its body has{Newline}
disappeared. If used before the unit's body disappears,{Newline}
a phoenix down, the monk's Revive, or the white magick{Newline}
Raise will revive a fallen unit.
{MClose}
{LS}The universe and all things within it are composed of{Newline}
eight elements: earth, fire, wind, water, ice, lightning,{Newline}
holy, and darkness. These elements and the relationships{Newline}
between them govern the fates of all beings. Although not{Newline}
everything in the universe has an elemental alignment,{Newline}
many units and items react to certain elements in special{Newline}
ways. In these cases, the following terms will be used in{Newline}
their help text descriptions.{Newline}
{Color 08}Absorbs:{Color 00} Damage of the specified elements is absorbed as{Newline}
HP. For example, when an ice-absorbing unit is attacked{Newline}
with the black magick Blizzard, the unit will recover HP{Newline}
instead of taking damage.{Newline}
{Color 08}Negates:{Color 00} Damage of the specified elements is negated.{Newline}
For example, when a lightning-negating unit is attacked{Newline}
with a magick such as Thunder, the unit receives no{Newline}
damage.{Newline}
{Color 08}Halves:{Color 00} Damage of the specified elements is halved.{Newline}
{Color 08}Weakness:{Color 00} Damage of the specified elements is increased.{Newline}
For example, if a unit with a weakness to fire is{Newline}
attacked with the Fire magick, the unit will take more{Newline}
damage than another would.{Newline}
{Color 08}Boosts:{Color 00} Damage of the specified elements dealt by the{Newline}
unit is increased. For example, when a unit with a boost{Newline}
to ice casts Blizzard, it will deal more damage than usual.
{MClose}
{LS}Various types of items can be equipped to different{Newline}
locations on a unit. Their effects vary accordingly.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Color 08}Right Hand, Left Hand{Color 00}{Newline}
Weapons may be equipped in the hands. Equipping a weapon{Newline}
will increase a unit's Attack attribute. If the weapon{Newline}
has a Parry rating, then the unit can also use it to{Newline}
block physical attacks.{Newline}
{LS}Normally, a unit can equip only a single weapon in{Newline}
either its right or left hand. Units with the Armor Lore{Newline}
ability can equip a shield regardless of their job. If the{Newline}
Dual Wield ability is assigned to a unit, it can equip a{Newline}
weapon in each hand. The Doublehand ability allows certain{Newline}
one-handed weapons to be wielded with both hands (two-{Newline}
handed weapons are always wielded with both hands and do{Newline}
not require the Doublehand ability to equip).{Newline}
{Color 08}Head{Color 00}{Newline}
Hats and helms may be equipped upon the head. Equipping{Newline}
these items will increase a unit's HP and/or MP. The{Newline}
headgear a unit may equip depends upon the unit's job and{Newline}
assigned support ability. The Armor Lore ability{Newline}
allows a unit to equip helms regardless of his or her job.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
{Color 08}Body{Color 00}{Newline}
Clothing, armor, and robes may be equipped upon the body.{Newline}
Equipping these items will increase a unit's HP and/or MP.{Newline}
The armor a unit may equip differs according to the{Newline}
unit's job and assigned support ability. The Armor Lore{Newline}
ability allows a unit to equip armor regardless of his or{Newline}
her job.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Color 08}Accessories{Color 00}{Newline}
Accessories include items such as shoes, rings, and{Newline}
cloaks. These items often provide unique effects, such as{Newline}
boosting attributes or granting immunity to status{Newline}
effects. For example, Battle Boots provide a +1 bonus to{Newline}
a unit's Move attribute.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
{LS}Pressing SELECT to view the help text for an item{Newline}
allows you to check its bonuses and compatible jobs.
{MClose}
{LS}A unit's job levels depend on the amount of JP the unit{Newline}
has earned towards each particular job. As a unit's job{Newline}
levels increase, new jobs will become available to that{Newline}
unit. For example, a unit must reach level 2 as a chemist{Newline}
in order to become a white mage.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
{LS}There are no prerequisites for becoming a squire or{Newline}
chemist. Once a unit has reached a squire job level of 2,{Newline}
he or she may become a knight or archer. Likewise, once a{Newline}
unit has reached a chemist job level of 2, he or she may{Newline}
become a white mage or black mage. There are many other{Newline}
jobs available to units as well, but you will have to{Newline}
discover their requirements on your own.

{Color 08}Black Mage:{Color 00} Arcane Strength (boost magick damage dealt){Newline}
{Color 08}Samurai:{Color 00} Doublehand (wield a weapon in two hands to{Newline}
boost damage){Newline}
{Color 08}Ninja:{Color 00} Dual Wield (wield a weapon in each hand to{Newline}
attack twice){Newline}
{LS}Some characters have special jobs that have different{Newline}
innate abilities than these examples.{Newline}
{Newline}
{LS}Monsters cannot be assigned abilities, but some{Newline}
monsters have innate reaction abilities like Counter,{Newline}
or special movement abilities like Fly.
{MClose}
{LS}Job points (JP) are required to raise a unit's job level{Newline}
and for a unit to learn new abilities. Job levels are{Newline}
determined by the total number of job points acquired. To{Newline}
advance to the next job level, a unit's total number of job{Newline}
points must reach the amount of points listed under{Newline}
"Next" in the job status window.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
{LS}Some of a unit's job points are consumed from its{Newline}
spending pool each time the unit learns a new ability.{Newline}
However, this does not affect the unit's total number of{Newline}
job points, which will never decrease.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
Job points may be acquired in the following ways:{Newline}
1. By successfully performing an action in battle.{Newline}
{Tab 0B}In this case, job points will be acquired for the{Newline}
{Tab 0B}unit's current job.{Newline}
2. By having a party member successfully perform{Newline}
{Tab 0B}an action in battle. The unit will gain points in{Newline}
{Tab 0B}the same job as that of the party member.{Newline}
{Newline}
3. By completing an errand accepted at a tavern.{Newline}
{Tab 0B}Job points will increase for the unit's current job{Newline}
{Tab 0B}after he or she has completed the task.
{MClose}
{LS}Each job has unique abilities to be learned. These{Newline}
abilities fall into four different categories:{Newline}

{MClose}
{LS}Abilities that have been learned must be assigned in{Newline}
order to be used. This applies to all abilities other than{Newline}
the unit's job command and any abilities inherent to the{Newline}
unit's chosen job.{Newline}
{Newline}

assigned to each unit:{Newline}
- Job command{Newline}
- Reaction ability{Newline}
- Support ability{Newline}
- Movement ability{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
{LS}To assign a new ability to a unit, you must do the{Newline}
following:{Newline}
1. Acquire enough job points for the job from which you{Newline}
{Tab 0B}wish to learn the ability.{Newline}
2. Spend the acquired job points to learn the ability.{Newline}
3. Assign the ability to the unit.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
{LS}All of the known action abilities for a particular job{Newline}
command are assigned to the unit when you assign that{Newline}
job command to the unit.
{MClose}
{LS}Reaction abilities are automatically triggered when{Newline}
the unit is targeted by another unit's action. Examples{Newline}

{LS}Taverns are located in cities and castles. At taverns,{Newline}
you can listen to the latest rumors in order to gain a{Newline}

as treasure hunting and other odd jobs, and send units to{Newline}
complete them.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
Errands can be completed in the following manner:{Newline}
{LS}1. View the description. {Newline}
{LS}2. Accept the task.{Newline}
{Tab 15}Select the units to dispatch.{Newline}
{Tab 15}Select the number of days to allow those units.{Newline}

{LS}4. Wait for your units to return.{Newline}
{LS}5. Return to the tavern to hear their report.{Newline}
{LS}When sending units out on a task, it is important to{Newline}
take their Bravery, Faith, and abilities into{Newline}
consideration. Depending on the nature of the errand, the{Newline}
units' jobs may also affect their chances of success.{Newline}
{LS}Once the allotted number of days has passed, your units{Newline}
will return to the same tavern from which they departed{Newline}
and give a report. After this report, the rewards and job{Newline}
points obtained by each unit will be shown.{Newline}
{LS}Different levels of success may be achieved for each{Newline}
task. An extremely successful errand can yield results{Newline}
great enough to be recorded in the Chronicle, such as the{Newline}
discovery of an ancient wonder or a lost artefact.{Newline}
Discovering enough of these will earn you honorary titles{Newline}

first-level units into your employ. It costs nothing to{Newline}

while to frequent the guild until you find a recruit to{Newline}

{LS}Warriors' guilds also allow you to change the names of{Newline}
any units who have joined your party.
{MClose}
{LS}Poachers' dens will appear in trade towns after a{Newline}
certain point in your adventure. The tradesmen at these{Newline}
guilds craft items from slain monsters and sell them to{Newline}
their members. Items that are broken or lost on the{Newline}
battlefield are also repaired and sold at poachers' dens.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
{LS}When a unit with the Poach ability slays a monster,{Newline}
guild craftsmen will use the remains to create items,{Newline}
which will then be sold at poachers' dens. When you lose{Newline}
or break an item with the Throw or Iaido commands, or if{Newline}
an enemy steals or breaks your equipment with a Steal,{Newline}
Rend, or Crush command, the item will be recovered and{Newline}
repaired to be sold in poachers' dens.{Newline}
{Newline}
{LS}Items in poachers' dens are sold at half the price they{Newline}
would be at a conventional outfitter, and there are some{Newline}
items that can only be purchased at poachers' dens.{Newline}
{Newline}
{LS}In order to enter a poachers' den, you must assign the{Newline}
Poach ability to at least one unit.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
{LS}Since poached monsters and lost equipment are required{Newline}
to stock the items sold at poachers' dens, there is a limit{Newline}
to the number of items available. The quantity of each item{Newline}
in stock will be shown as you shop. As you poach more{Newline}

{LS}The battle ends once all units belonging to either player{Newline}
are KO'd. If the action limit is reached before this{Newline}
occurs, the player with the most remaining units at the{Newline}
end of the battle is the winner. If both players have the{Newline}
same number of units left, the battle ends in a draw.{Newline}
{LS}After the battle, three items are awarded to the{Newline}
winner, and one is awarded to the loser. In the case of a{Newline}
draw, two items are awarded to each player.
{MClose}
{LS}Units KO'd in melee are not permanently lost. They will{Newline}
disappear from the battlefield when their KO countdowns{Newline}
expire, but rejoin the party after battle. All equipment{Newline}
and items which are consumed or destroyed during battle{Newline}
will likewise be restored to their previous states once{Newline}
the battle has ended.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
{LS}The only unit attribute that changes permanently as a{Newline}

{Newline}
- If the hit probability for an attack is near 50%, both{Newline}

{Tab 07}attack is confirmed. The outcome will depend on which{Newline}
{Tab 07}player presses the button the greater number of times.{Newline}
- If a unit enters a tile containing a trap, a sequence of{Newline}
{Tab 07}buttons will be displayed. Pressing the correct buttons in{Newline}
{Tab 07}the correct order within the time limit will disarm the{Newline}
{Tab 07}trap.
{MClose}
{LS}Setting the trap placement method to either "Random"{Newline}
or "Manual" enables the placement of traps on the melee{Newline}
map. If a unit moves into a tile trapped by the opposing{Newline}
player, the unit will be affected in one of several ways,{Newline}
depending on the type of trap. Traps you placed cannot be{Newline}
triggered by your own units. However, your units will be{Newline}
affected if they are within the area of effect of a trap{Newline}

{LS}Rendezvousing with another player allows you to team{Newline}
up in order to complete cooperative missions via Ad Hoc{Newline}
Mode. Select "Rendezvous" from the menu in any tavern to{Newline}
access them. After selecting "Start a Mission" from the{Newline}
Rendezvous submenu, you will be given the option of{Newline}
hosting a mission or joining one hosted by another player.{Newline}
One player should select "Host Mission," while the other{Newline}
selects "Join Mission."{Newline}
{LS}Once a connection is made, the hosting player will be{Newline}
prompted to select a mission. All missions for which{Newline}
either player has fulfilled the necessary requirements will{Newline}
be available to choose from. Once a decision has been made{Newline}
by the host and confirmed by the other player, both will{Newline}
then proceed to the squad formation screen.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
{LS}Cooperative battles are much the same as single-player{Newline}
battles, but the number of units allowed in battle will{Newline}
differ according to the mission. There are also several{Newline}
special rules that apply to cooperative battles. As in{Newline}
melee, KO'd units are not permanently removed from your{Newline}
party, and units gain no EXP in battle. Additionally, the{Newline}
use of Arithmeticks is prohibited.{Newline}
{Newline}
{LS}Fulfilling the objectives displayed at the start of battle{Newline}
completes the mission. The participants will then be{Newline}
evaluated on a scale of one to five stars, and awarded{Newline}
items according to the results. You can repeat a{Newline}
particular mission any number of times, allowing you to{Newline}
keep trying until you earn the best evaluation.
{MClose}
{LS}Only one mission will be available at first, but new{Newline}
ones will be unlocked as you advance through the game and{Newline}
fulfill certain requirements. The currently available{Newline}
missions and their descriptions may be viewed at any{Newline}
tavern by selecting "Rendezvous," then "View Available{Newline}
Missions."{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
{LS}The hosting player is always responsible for selecting{Newline}
the mission. However, all missions unlocked by either{Newline}
player will appear in the list for the hosting player to{Newline}
choose from.
{MClose}
{LS}Only a small number of units are permitted in your{Newline}
squad for cooperative mission battles. Most missions{Newline}
allow a maximum of three units per player, and some only{Newline}
allow two units each. Some missions require that multiple{Newline}
battles be fought in succession.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
Abilities are restricted in the following ways:{Newline}
{LS}1. Arithmeticks cannot be used.{Newline}
{LS}2. No gil can be acquired.{Newline}
{LS}3. Poaching is not possible.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
{LS}The Arithmeticks ability cannot be used at all, and{Newline}
abilities that allow a unit to acquire gil have no effect.{Newline}
When the Poach ability is assigned to a unit, it may{Newline}
result in monsters being successfully poached during{Newline}
battle, but nothing will become available at poachers' dens{Newline}
as a result. Keep these rules in mind when assigning{Newline}
abilities to your units.
{MClose}
{LS}Only two unit attributes will change permanently as a{Newline}
result of mission battles: JP, and abilities learned from{Newline}
crystals on the battlefield. All other attributes will be{Newline}
reset to their original values at the battle's end. Poached{Newline}
monsters and units transformed by malboro spores will{Newline}
also be restored to their former states.
{MClose}
{LS}Units KO'd in cooperative battles are not permanently{Newline}
lost. They will disappear from the battlefield when their{Newline}
KO countdowns expire, but rejoin the party after the{Newline}
mission has been completed. When completing missions{Newline}
that consist of multiple battles in a row, units defeated{Newline}
in one battle will not be able to participate in any{Newline}
subsequent battles, greatly hindering your ability to{Newline}
fight.
{MClose}
{LS}Once a mission is completed, all lost items will be{Newline}
restored and any items obtained during battle will be{Newline}
added to the party inventory. Restored items include{Newline}
consumables that were used with the Items or Auto-{Newline}
Potion abilities, stolen equipment, equipment destroyed{Newline}
by enemy attacks, katana shattered when using Iaido,{Newline}
and weapons thrown with the Throw ability.{Newline}
{Newline}
{LS}Although items are restored after completing a{Newline}
mission, keep in mind that losing them will make it more{Newline}
difficult to complete the mission in the first place. It{Newline}
would still be wise to assign the Safeguard or Reequip{Newline}
abilities to units to ensure they are not deprived of{Newline}
equipment.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
{LS}Items which may be acquired in battle include those{Newline}
taken from chests, weapons caught with the Sticky{Newline}
Fingers ability, and equipment stolen from enemies. You{Newline}
cannot take items from the other player's units. After{Newline}
successfully completing the mission, a number of rewards{Newline}
will be awarded to each player as well.
{MClose}
{LS}Although you are unable to acquire gil during mission{Newline}
battles, a gil bonus is awarded for completing the battle,{Newline}
just as it is for completing a normal battle.
{MClose}
{LS}Items are awarded to each player upon completion of a{Newline}
mission. The value of these rewards depends on luck. The{Newline}
items are kept hidden in chests, making it impossible to{Newline}
know what item will be obtained until a chest is chosen.{Newline}
The number of chests each player may open depends on the{Newline}
evaluations they receive.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
{LS}Mission results are evaluated on a scale of one to five,{Newline}
and a better evaluation results in more items being{Newline}
awarded. The maximum number of items awarded is five.{Newline}
To receive a higher evaluation, you must defeat more{Newline}
enemies or complete the mission with a smaller number of{Newline}
units. If your units are KO'd, your evaluation will go down.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
{LS}The tavernmaster will inform you of your evaluation{Newline}
once the mission is over. After you have cleared a{Newline}
particular task at least once, you may check your{Newline}
evaluation at any time by selecting "Rendezvous" and then{Newline}
"View Available Missions." The number of stars displayed{Newline}
to the right of the title indicates your best evaluation{Newline}
for that particular mission.

{LS}The merchant ship Highwind had sunk some 20 sectas{Newline}
out into Warjilis Harbor. As it was carrying the molds{Newline}
needed to create chocobons, Psalmba Exports' newest{Newline}
product, some have speculated that the ship may have been{Newline}
sunk by a rival firm. However, it was determined to be an{Newline}
accident when we successfully recovered both the ship and{Newline}
its cargo.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}The salvage expedition was sponsored by the Lesalia{Newline}
Adventurers' Guild. Most attendees were young men and{Newline}
women from landlocked regions who would otherwise never{Newline}
get the chance to scour the depths for sunken treasure.{Newline}
Happily, we found a sunken hull (like as not placed there by{Newline}
our hosts) and succeeded in rescuing it from its watery{Newline}
grave.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}We took part in a diving expedition sponsored by{Newline}
Thompson Traders, an outfitter located in Yardrow. There{Newline}
was a wide variety of participants, from children to the{Newline}
elderly, including many who might otherwise never have the{Newline}
opportunity to go diving for treasure. Diving is not easy{Newline}
work, but the participants accepted this and had a{Newline}
fulfilling, if exhausting, time.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}The Rhana Strait, located between Ivalice and the{Newline}
Romandan peninsula, is infamous for its treacherous{Newline}
waters. The Enterprise is only one of the many ships the{Newline}
strait has claimed. Judging from the vessel's extravagant{Newline}
design, it like as not belonged to a noble, but there are no{Newline}
records of its ownership, and no hint as to why the{Newline}
information was covered up.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}We responded to the Zeltennia Salvagers' Guild call for{Newline}
divers. The guild's operations had been on hiatus since a{Newline}
scandal several years ago, and only resumed as of late.{Newline}
Still, one would never know it from the contract that we{Newline}
were made to sign, even for our short employment. As we{Newline}
worked, we couldn't help but wonder what would become of{Newline}
this guild, surrounded as it was by dark rumors.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}We were informed that a trade ship called the{Newline}
Hindenburg, registered to a Zaland trade company, went{Newline}
down 16 sectas into the Bay of Obell. Prohibitive costs{Newline}
kept the company from turning to a licensed salvage guild.{Newline}
The waters in the area make it difficult to avoid the{Newline}
occasional shipwreck, and the local guilds take advantage{Newline}
of the lack of competition to charge steep rates.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}We were told of a sunken vessel known as the Falcon at{Newline}
the bottom of the West Bugross Sea. The Falcon was{Newline}
thought to have encountered a typhoon as it carried{Newline}
tributes from the continent, sinking the ship and drowning{Newline}
her crew. Among those lost was a Lord Hamilton, emissary{Newline}
to the Walled City of Yardrow. The job served to remind{Newline}
us all how dangerous sea travel can be.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}We learned that a ship said to belong to Mesa, the hero-{Newline}
king who saved humanity in the Cataclysm, had foundered{Newline}
not far off the shores of Goug. We immediately set to{Newline}
work and succeeded in raising the great vessel. However,{Newline}
a cursory examination of the ship revealed modern{Newline}
construction. We later learned that the vessel belonged to{Newline}
the Estoire Trading Company in Goug. We had been fooled.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}We learned that the Durga, a merchant ship owned by{Newline}
Barnvell Imports, had sunk 40 sectas into the Gulf of{Newline}
Carnen. As the Durga carried a number of valuable goods{Newline}
from the farthest corners of the continent, company{Newline}
representatives were understandably nervous. We raised{Newline}
the vessel, but her cargo had largely dissolved in the brine,{Newline}
resulting in a substantial loss for the company.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}A ship carrying a Lionel emissary was attacked by{Newline}
pirates and sunk in waters not far off the coast. Her{Newline}
cargo was clearly of extraordinary importance, as{Newline}
countless others were working to raise the ship when we{Newline}
arrived. Luckily, we were able to raise her and quickly{Newline}
performed a search. In one of the passenger cabins, we{Newline}
found a treasure that we claimed for ourselves.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}We caught word that a vessel bearing gifts to the{Newline}
Zaland Embassy had sunk. It apparently had been ravaged{Newline}
by strong winds, as it was almost unrecognizable when we{Newline}
raised it from the deep. The gifts it had carried were of{Newline}
great value, and were to serve as a symbol of strong ties{Newline}
between Zaland and the main continent. This loss is bound{Newline}
to cause a bit of a rift between the two.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}Several valuable tomes were stolen from the Gariland{Newline}
Akademy for the Magickal Arts. According to witnesses,{Newline}
the thief was a man of some thirty years. He was seen{Newline}
escaping from a second-floor window and boarding a nearby{Newline}
ferry. Unfortunately for him, the ferry sank. We raised{Newline}
the vessel, but were unable to locate the books. Mayhap{Newline}
they were washed away by the current.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}We answered the Yardrow Salvage Guild's call for{Newline}
divers. Attracted by the guild's claims of high income for{Newline}
little effort, we quickly found it to be just the opposite.{Newline}
We were worked from early morning until late at night for{Newline}
a pittance. But at the very least we have learned that{Newline}
when something sounds too good to be true, it oft is.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}Gleddia Isle lies 15 sectas into the Inlet of Riovanes.{Newline}
Waters in the area are swift and shallow, making{Newline}
shipwrecks a common occurrence. However, as it is the{Newline}
closest route to the inlet, many merchants who know not{Newline}
of its treachery still venture near and are sunk. This was{Newline}
no doubt the case with the ship we raised as well.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}Another ship ran aground just off the coast of Gleddia{Newline}
Isle, some 15 sectas out into the Inlet of Riovanes. The{Newline}
ship was the Delphi, a large merchant vessel owned by{Newline}
Eastgable Merchantry. As the ship was unregistered, we{Newline}
conducted a routine search and discovered a large quantity{Newline}
of illegal drugs being smuggled from the mainland. The{Newline}
cargo was worth some 70 million gil on the open market.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}The Dawn Queen, a merchant vessel owned by Galesta{Newline}
Trading, capsized 35 sectas into the Bay of Seijista. It{Newline}
seems that a birthday present for the company's owner{Newline}
was on board. Moved by his assistant Holsecca's concern{Newline}
for the man, we raised the vessel. Upon recovery of the{Newline}
cargo, we were surprised to hear that Holsecca had in{Newline}
truth been worried only for his job.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}The abandoned mine expedition was sponsored by the{Newline}
Lesalia Adventurers' Guild. Most attendees were young{Newline}
men and women from coastal regions who might otherwise{Newline}
never explore places such as this. Luckily, we struck a{Newline}
vein of ore and even uncovered some lost treasure, making{Newline}
this task a profitable one.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}We took part in a mining expedition sponsored by{Newline}
Thompson Traders, a Yardrow outfitter. There was a{Newline}
wide variety of participants, both men and women, including{Newline}
many who might otherwise never have the opportunity to{Newline}
try their hand at mining. Mining is no easy task, but the{Newline}
participants seemed to accept this and had a fulfilling, if{Newline}
exhausting, time.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}An information broker told us of a hidden vein of ore{Newline}
in the long-abandoned Coldmann Mine. Apparently, it was{Newline}
mentioned in the will of Old Toppa, the mine's former{Newline}
manager. However, when we contacted Old Toppa's family,{Newline}
we learned that his will had been stolen. Working with the{Newline}
city guard, we apprehended the informant, a man named{Newline}
Gordon, and restored the mining rights to the family.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}We took part in a mining expedition sponsored by{Newline}
Thompson Traders, a Yardrow outfitter. These trips seem{Newline}
to be quite popular, as this is the second one that the{Newline}
company has held in only a short period of time. The{Newline}
location was moved to a more challenging mine this time,{Newline}
but luckily one of the younger participants (Gotti, a boy{Newline}
of nine) was able to find a vein of ore for us to mine.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}We responded to a call for miners from the Ural Mine.{Newline}
Only a short amount of time had passed since the incident{Newline}
that had suspended operations but the mining company was{Newline}
eager to make up for lost time. While we were digging, we{Newline}
encountered a gigantic boulder, but with the help of all the{Newline}
miners we were able to move it. This task reminded us{Newline}
that any obstacle can be overcome with enough hard work.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}The Orra Mine, famous for a spectacular vein of gold,{Newline}
suffered a cave-in not long ago. It seems that in their{Newline}
rush to mine the gold, the miners were too greedy and dug{Newline}
too deep. Ten miners lost their lives in the cave-in, but{Newline}
the company still continues to mine and has yet to admit{Newline}
any wrongdoing.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}The Ducatia Mine has put out a request for miners.{Newline}
This generally occurs only when new veins of ore are{Newline}
discovered, and since no new ore has been found in this{Newline}
mine since the discovery of a copper vein several years{Newline}
ago, this would indeed be good news. But since the copper{Newline}
miners are still employed, some suspect this urgent need{Newline}
for extra miners can only mean gold has been discovered.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}Mount Gulg has not erupted for nigh on 5000 years,{Newline}
yet dangers enough remain that few dare venture near.{Newline}
But we did, and it was at the bottom of that deep, dark{Newline}
shaft we saw her: a lady of flame! Locals tell of a young{Newline}
girl who stumbled over the volcano's rim, though the truth{Newline}
of it we could not say. Nonetheless, we erected a small{Newline}
shrine and offered prayers for the Mount Gulg Maiden.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}At last we returned from the Endless Caverns. It{Newline}
seems the unique nature of the caverns was the reason{Newline}
why none had ever before returned. The caves' strong{Newline}
magnetic field and monotonous, grid-like layout have a{Newline}
paralyzing effect on one's sense of direction. However,{Newline}
marking our path allowed us to escape and at last dispel{Newline}
the mystery surrounding the caverns.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}We have conquered the Himca Cliffs! Searching for a{Newline}
hidden vein of gold, we reached the top of the misty{Newline}
peaks, and fields of grass seemed to extend endlessly{Newline}
before us. In the distance stood an enormous tree, the{Newline}
likes of which we had never seen. Mayhap it was the World{Newline}
Tree itself. As we left, we felt as if we had witnessed{Newline}
one of the wonders of the world.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}We found a god in the Godsvale! We dug down some 30{Newline}
sectas in search of ore deposits when our trench opened{Newline}
up into some ancient catacombs. We had just constructed a{Newline}
small shrine, and were praying for the souls interred in{Newline}
the tombs around us, when suddenly the figure of a man{Newline}
garbed in shimmering robes appeared before us. Then he{Newline}
disappeared as quickly as he came.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}We discovered that mining had resumed in Balvack{Newline}
Mine, albeit on a temporary basis. The miners sought to{Newline}
put any rumors of hidden gold to rest once and for all, and{Newline}
of course we joined them. As we were digging, an old{Newline}
miner remarked, "It feels like we're back in the gold rush{Newline}
again." What could that old man have seen in that empty{Newline}
shell of a mine?
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}Ducatia Mine was again recruiting miners. As only days{Newline}
had passed since the first recruitment drive, we decided{Newline}
to look into the situation. Upon being hired, we were{Newline}
subjected to an even stricter examination before finally{Newline}
being allowed into the mine itself. Once inside, we{Newline}
confirmed that a gold vein had indeed been discovered and{Newline}
was being mined in secret.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}The Lorraide Mine went bankrupt several years ago,{Newline}
just after striking mythril. According to former miners,{Newline}
a secret vein of ore was locked behind a door at the very{Newline}
bottom of the mine. We immediately investigated. The{Newline}
mine had transformed into a veritable dungeon, and when{Newline}
we finally opened the door at its bottom, we found the{Newline}
ghost of a miner, still digging from the rich vein.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}A gold rush some years ago caused numerous towns to{Newline}
crop up at the foot of Mount Ourobos, and for a time the{Newline}
mountain crawled with prospectors. However, the meager{Newline}
amount of gold found could not support the towns. The{Newline}
miners soon left, turning the villages into little more than{Newline}
ghost towns. All that remained of the miners' dreams were{Newline}
the tears of the old man who told us his tale.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}To combat the theft and violence prevalent during the{Newline}
Fifty Years' War, the Sal Ghidos Council created an elite{Newline}
guard made of fifteen knights who had proven their worth{Newline}
on the battlefield. This group of black-clad warriors was{Newline}
known as the Sable Swords. It is said they perished after{Newline}
falling prey to a bandit's trap in Death's Gorge, but even{Newline}
today people report sightings of ghostly figures in black.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}The Merchant Council of Dorter sponsored a frontier{Newline}
marathon. Participants competed with one another to find{Newline}
lost remnants of ancient civilization. All we had to go on{Newline}
was information gleaned from ancient texts, legends, and{Newline}
stories as we raced to be the first to find undiscovered{Newline}
ruins.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}Combing Lake Poescas for lost ruins, we were startled{Newline}
to see a dark shadow move by in the distance. Consulting{Newline}
with a scholar learned in such matters, we learned that{Newline}
the lake had been part of the sea in ancient times. He{Newline}
believed we had witnessed a rare appearance of Poessie,{Newline}
an ancient sea dragon trapped there when Lake Poescas{Newline}
was cut off from the sea by geological shifts.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}The Merchant Council of Dorter sponsored a second{Newline}
frontier marathon. There were even more participants{Newline}
this time, and a change to the rules allowed us to use{Newline}
vehicles, which greatly increased the potential search{Newline}
area. We rented a chocobo carriage not far from the{Newline}
starting area, and succeeded yet again in finding a lost{Newline}
ancient wonder.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}The Lenalian Plateau is thought to be home to demons{Newline}
and all manner of evil spirit. A line from local legend{Newline}
reads, "And a demon descended upon the high plateau of{Newline}
Lenalia, and the world was plunged into darkness."{Newline}
However, we witnessed only a series of quiet, rolling hills{Newline}
with no apparent relation to the cursed land of legend. And{Newline}
yet as we left, we did feel a strange chill.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}The Merchant Council of Dorter sponsored a third{Newline}
frontier marathon. The success of the first two races{Newline}
meant that there were even more participants this time.{Newline}
Some complained of the expanded search area, but after{Newline}
the race began, everyone seemed to enjoy themselves. It is{Newline}
said that the next race will not be held for some time,{Newline}
until more reports of lost ruins have surfaced.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}One of the main trade routes between Gariland and{Newline}
Dorter passes through the Siedge Weald. Said route was{Newline}
only opened of late, mayhap to avoid the bandits on the{Newline}
Lenalian Plateau. It therefore abounds with areas yet to{Newline}
be explored, and we used the knowledge given us to{Newline}
discover the ancient wonder deep within the weald.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}The Beddha Sandwaste crawls with monsters. We were{Newline}
warned of this on the very day we set off in search of the{Newline}
lost ruins. A monster known as a sandworm is said to{Newline}
appear at the end of each month, bringing blackened skies{Newline}
and sandstorms that shut the desert off from the outside{Newline}
world. Is this an attempt to protect the ruins' legacy, or a{Newline}
message to humans who dare defile remnants of the past?
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}Lamzen the Adventurer hailed from the main continent,{Newline}
coming to Ivalice by way of Romanda. He was an explorer{Newline}
of some renown on the mainland, and made a number of{Newline}
important discoveries there. We joined his party and set{Newline}
off, exploring the unfamiliar Zeklaus Desert. Thanks in{Newline}
part to his experience, we located the ruins.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}After hearing the old farmer's account, we made our{Newline}
way to Dugeura Pass. There we witnessed an unusual local{Newline}
ceremony, in which they danced around an elemental. We{Newline}
later learned that it was a sacrificial ceremony in ancient{Newline}
times, performed today as part of a festival. Although{Newline}
unrelated to the ruins we found beyond the pass, it was{Newline}
an interesting sight nevertheless.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}We took part in a frontier expedition. Such expeditions{Newline}
are popular, for the prospect of discovering lost wonders{Newline}
gives hope to those exhausted by the mundanity of{Newline}
everyday life. As a surprising number of people attended,{Newline}
we divided ourselves into groups of 10 and set off{Newline}
exploring at dawn. We forged deep into the jungle, where{Newline}
we found remnants of an ancient, advanced civilization.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}The poisonous fens of the Tchigolith Fenlands are a{Newline}
remnant of the Fifty Years' War, and even today their{Newline}
desolation bears silent witness to the brutality of that{Newline}
conflict. But as we were departing for home, we saw{Newline}
something extraordinary: a celsettia flower blooming amid{Newline}
the deadly mists. By the time our children are grown,{Newline}
might these fens again be covered in celsettia blossoms?
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}Judging by its design and style, Master Joshul, who has{Newline}
studied ancient architecture for a half century, was of{Newline}
the opinion that the dungeon found beneath the marquis's{Newline}
estate was a relic of ancient civilization. Such labyrinths{Newline}
were used to protect valuable artefacts, and with the help{Newline}
of Master Joshul, we were able to reach its center and{Newline}
discover the ancient wonder that lay within.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}The Vaschons are an unusual group of adventurers,{Newline}
exploring regions previously untouched by man and then{Newline}
teaching others about them. As their notoriety has grown,{Newline}
so have their numbers, but the captain's natural leadership{Newline}
ability allows her to easily coordinate their efforts. She{Newline}
recorded every step of our journey, from beginning to{Newline}
successful discovery. We look forward to reading it later.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}We headed off to investigate the farmer's tale. The{Newline}
mountain was beautiful, bathed in mist like something out{Newline}
of a fairy tale. Yet even in that seemingly untouched{Newline}
wilderness, the effects of the war were evident. We will{Newline}
not tell you what we saw there; it is best seen for{Newline}
oneself. We left with mixed emotions, knowing that even{Newline}
this hidden bit of paradise would eventually disappear.

{LS}They say that faith reveals all things, but it seems{Newline}
this does not apply to lost ruins. The man who told us of{Newline}
these ruins, a merchant by the name of Bibbitt, has faith{Newline}
only in gold. When we told him of the ruins we had{Newline}
discovered, he ran from the tavern to see for himself. We{Newline}
can only hope this whole experience taught him that there{Newline}
is more to life than gold.

{LS}Mount Vector is a mysterious place where rain falls{Newline}
continuously. This soft rain was quite relaxing and served{Newline}
to soothe our battle-weary bones. The high temperatures{Newline}
in the region mean that the mountain is always swathed{Newline}
in mist, leading to stories of white demons that prey on{Newline}
travelers. We located the ruins, and bid this oasis for the{Newline}
soul a reluctant farewell, before continuing on our journey.

{LS}Twilight Gustkov had become the leader of the Wyverns.{Newline}
In addition to a string of robberies, the outlaw band was{Newline}
suspected of playing a part in the kidnapping of a member{Newline}
of the royal family, prompting the Crown to place a{Newline}
sizeable bounty on Gustkov's head. We bested him after a{Newline}
lengthy struggle, and were given a generous reward during{Newline}
a rare public appearance by Celebrant Palcino.

{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}A rash of monster attacks had finally resulted in the{Newline}
loss of human life. The behemoth that had taken up{Newline}
residence in the mountains near Bervenia killed Cassandra,{Newline}
the owner of a nearby farm, and some thirty others.{Newline}
Although we were successful in our efforts to slay the{Newline}
beast, our battle with this king of monsters was{Newline}
uncomfortably close.

{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}Bacchus Winery's most popular product is Bacchus{Newline}
Liqueur, an incredibly sweet drink made from bacchus{Newline}
seeds, and it was the reason for the attacks on the{Newline}
company's wains. What was thought to be the work of{Newline}
bandits was actually that of monsters drawn to the sweet{Newline}
smell. We defeated them and their leader Lilith, ensuring{Newline}
that Ivalicians could again partake of Bacchus's blessing.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}Enticed by the offer of reward, we set off to find a{Newline}
dragon. After a fierce battle in the Glenn Peaks, we{Newline}
succeeded in slaying one. No sooner had we extracted its{Newline}
tooth than we found ourselves ringed by soldiers—the{Newline}
duke's men. Duke McEnroe himself was present, and gave{Newline}
us a fine reward for the tooth. We felt a tinge of pity{Newline}
for the duke, who must buy his own son's respect.

{LS}The labyrinthine cave on the outskirts of Warjilis led{Newline}
to a vast underground lake. We sensed we were being{Newline}
watched as we stared across the water, and turned to see{Newline}
a pack of red mousses ready to pounce. After overcoming{Newline}
our foes, we saw an astonishing sight: the blossom of a{Newline}
whisperweed, a plant that blooms only once in several{Newline}
millenia. Could the monsters have been protecting it?

{LS}Typhoon Karzst has been captured! We learned that{Newline}
Bevester Karzst, wanted for 765 counts of purse-{Newline}
snatching, was hiding in Sal Ghidos, and quickly set out{Newline}
to capture him. We were aided by a mysterious ninja clad{Newline}

{LS}Count Minimas has been exposed! After defeating the{Newline}

whereupon we were startled to discover a cache of gold{Newline}
and documents hidden in the count's cellar. The nature of{Newline}
the documents would take too long to explain here, but{Newline}
suffice to say they removed any chance of the count{Newline}
winning the upcoming mayoral election.

{LS}The cave mimic is an unusual predator whose enormous{Newline}
mouth resembles that of a cave. Usually found in natural{Newline}
caverns, this one had taken up residence at the entrance{Newline}
to the Ural mythril mine. Word among the miners was that{Newline}
an adamantitan that had once dwelt in the mine had cursed{Newline}
it, summoning the mimic. Whatever the reason for the{Newline}
mimic's presence, it was a most unusual task.

{LS}Zerro struck again, targeting Viscount Barfire this{Newline}
time. Zerro, who seems to target corrupt aristocrats,{Newline}
infiltrated the noble's manor dressed as a guard. He fled{Newline}
with paintings, gold, and other treasure. We managed to{Newline}
corner him in the gardens, but he disappeared in a cloud of{Newline}
smoke, leaving behind a message and treasure. After{Newline}
verifying he was gone, we claimed the treasure and left.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}Zerro struck again! This time, his target was Baron{Newline}
Barthundra, a dealer in art. Unbeknownst to the baron,{Newline}
Zerro had been hired as an assistant at his gallery,{Newline}
allowing him to pilfer paintings, gold, and other valuables{Newline}
undetected. Before disappearing yet again, he left behind{Newline}
a note and a treasure. After ensuring we were not being{Newline}
watched, we claimed the treasure and headed for home.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}Zerro returned for another heist, this time targeting{Newline}
Baron Barfrost. Given Zerro's history, we thought it{Newline}
best to guard the baron's priceless art collection. Despite{Newline}
our best preparations, Zerro gained access to the Baron's{Newline}
estate in the guise of a gardener and escaped with{Newline}
paintings and gold. Before vanishing into the night, he{Newline}
left behind a message and a treasure, which we took.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}Zerro struck again, this time against Magister Bardeth.{Newline}
The city guard did their best to stop him, but Zerro gained{Newline}
access to the magisterial estate in the guise of a cook,{Newline}
sneaking past the guards and escaping with priceless{Newline}
treasures and gold. Though the magister's collection of fine{Newline}
art is famous, not a single work was stolen. The city guard{Newline}
was left in confusion.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}At last we know what Zerro was truly after—a golden{Newline}
Mashmal drachma. This coin, a relic of old Ivalice, was{Newline}
minted by Focara's late grandfather, and she wished to{Newline}
return it to her grandfather's grave. Zerro learned this,{Newline}
and pilfered it in an attempt to woo her. Slipping away,{Newline}
Zerro was heard to say, "As long as there is injustice,{Newline}
and as long as there is hope, Zerro will always return!"

{LS}The chimera, once thought extinct, had indeed{Newline}
reappeared. Such an abomination—a foul creation bearing{Newline}
the features of countless beasts—could only have been{Newline}
wrought by the hand of man. It stands to reason that the{Newline}
chimera was the work of dark sorcery, and rumor would{Newline}
place responsibility on one of the townspeople. We managed{Newline}
to fell the beast in a battle that spanned some eight hours.

{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}We were called to assist in an unusual case of pet-{Newline}
turned-monster. The metamorphosis resulted from magicks{Newline}
that the pet's owner, young Diara Luca, had found in an{Newline}
ancient tome in her family library. After disposing of the{Newline}
pet and questioning Diara, we learned that the chimera{Newline}
seen in town not long ago was also hers. We released her{Newline}
after eliciting a promise that she stop experimenting.

{LS}The Braana clan has been defeated! The pirates had{Newline}
been plundering small fishing villages on the outskirts of{Newline}
town, taking hostages from each to keep others from{Newline}
calling for help. But thanks to the bravery of a ten-year-{Newline}
old girl named Fia in a tiny fishing village near Riovanes{Newline}
Castle, we were notified of the pirates' plot, and the{Newline}
craven lot was brought to justice.

{LS}Lady Vitts, the proprietress of an inn near Zeltennia{Newline}
Castle, lost her six-year-old son Gallua to an accident.{Newline}
However, as we discovered during our investigation, she{Newline}
was convinced he still lived. According to a doctor learned{Newline}
in such matters, the trauma of losing her son caused the{Newline}
good lady to lose touch with reality, resulting in this{Newline}
errand which we were sadly unable to complete.

{LS}Little Cornelia, Baron Catastro's only daughter, was{Newline}
kidnapped by a man calling himself "Jacques le rapeur" and{Newline}
demanding the Catastro family jewels. We met the culprit{Newline}
on the pretense of delivering them. As it turned out,{Newline}
"Jacques le rapeur" was actually a man by the name of{Newline}
Roberts—Cornelia's tutor. Cornelia had planned the{Newline}
kidnapping in an attempt to reunite her estranged parents.

{LS}Duke McEnroe's son was kidnapped by brigands claiming{Newline}
to work against the nobility. The city guard conducted{Newline}
their own investigation, supplemented by an outside{Newline}
search party at the request of the duke. Working with{Newline}
members of the guard, we infiltrated the culprits'{Newline}
hideout, and rescued young Pappal. It seems the men's{Newline}
ultimate goal was the dissolution of Ivalice's aristocracy.

{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}Carrot, a five-month-old malboro kept as a pet by{Newline}
Countess Zalmasse, had gone missing. After an extended{Newline}
search, we found Carrot feeding in the hills behind{Newline}
Zalmasse Manor and recaptured her. Consulting with a{Newline}
specialist, we learned that domesticated malboros regress{Newline}
to their wild state every fourth generation, and{Newline}
determined this was the cause of little Carrot's escape.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}We headed to an old house on the outskirts of Lesalia to{Newline}
investigate the cause of mysterious noises. They started{Newline}
late that night and seemed to be emanating from a room on{Newline}
the second floor. Upon entering the room, we found a doll{Newline}
crying alone in the pitch blackness. Later, we learned that{Newline}
the house's former residents had died in a fire many years{Newline}
ago. Was the doll lamenting the fate of its owner?
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}We looked into the items washing up on the shore near{Newline}
the city of Gariland. We mostly found refuse from cities{Newline}
across the sea, but amongst the garbage we saw a small{Newline}
bottle containing a scrap of paper. Although we were{Newline}
unable to decipher the foreign script inscribed on the{Newline}
paper, it appeared to be a plea of some sort.

{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}We were asked by residents of Goug to defeat a{Newline}
monster living in an abandoned well. What we found at its{Newline}
dark, dank bottom was a figure in the shape of a man,{Newline}
covered from head to toe in mud. It took all of our{Newline}
strength to defeat it. From its remains crawled a{Newline}
bedraggled vagrant. It seems that he had taken shelter in{Newline}
the well, only to be engulfed by the mud monster.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}We followed up on reports of a strange figure seen{Newline}
prowling the streets of Zeltennia. We soon spied our{Newline}
quarry, but as we followed him, our surroundings suddenly{Newline}
seemed unfamiliar. The figure was none other than the{Newline}
legendary phantom known as the Black Cape, and it had{Newline}
trapped us within an umbral prison. However, our faith{Newline}
and bravery allowed us to break free and defeat the shade.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}Our investigation of an abandoned dwelling just within{Newline}
the outer wall of Limberry Castle revealed arteficers'{Newline}
tools of varying design and a golem some 4 sectas from{Newline}
head to toe. The golem attacked, and we destroyed it only{Newline}
with great difficulty. Not long afterward, the golem's{Newline}
creator, a man by the name of Master Gell, returned. He{Newline}
claimed to be experimenting in alchemical reanimation.

{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}For five days, thirty students of the Riovanes{Newline}
Military Institute had confined themselves to an ancient{Newline}
mountain temple outside of town. It seems this was in{Newline}
protest for beatings received at the hands of their{Newline}
teachers. The Ivalician Minister of Education has taken{Newline}
the charges very seriously, and dismissed a number of{Newline}
faculty members from the school, including the headmaster.

{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}Our investigation revealed that there was indeed a spy{Newline}
in the secret society's ranks. Heckern Mauer, a man of{Newline}
one-and-forty, had been hired by a rival group as a spy.{Newline}
Through his testimony, we learned the society had been{Newline}
trafficking in endangered resplendent chocobo plumes. We{Newline}
searched their base, whereupon one of the smugglers{Newline}
confessed, helping us take down the entire syndicate.

{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}Viscount Lachayle entrusted us with a centuries-old{Newline}
family heirloom, so that we might determine if it was{Newline}
genuine. Consulting various experts, we obtained proof of{Newline}
its authenticity. However, the viscount's remark that he{Newline}
loved it above all else led to the dissolution of his marriage{Newline}
while we were away. He seemed to learn from the{Newline}
experience, and gave us the treasure upon our return.

{LS}Count Minimas, famed for his yearly contributions to{Newline}
local Dorter charities, could not open his family vault. It{Newline}

of the lavish lifestyles that nobles lead, we felt Count{Newline}
Minimas and his charity work a shining example in our{Newline}
corrupt society, and so we were happy to aid him.

{LS}We discovered that the raffleshiva, the legendary man-{Newline}

its blossoms can reach 5 sectas in diameter. It reached{Newline}

find.

{LS}Anna, the renowned singer, is to be married! After{Newline}
seven years of long-distance romance, a date is finally set.{Newline}
The lucky man is none other than Edward, a bard employed{Newline}
at Riovanes. Edward's gentlemanly manner has caused many{Newline}
to suspect he may be a prince in disguise—mayhap of{Newline}
continental royalty. This charm is no doubt what attracted{Newline}
Anna to him. We wish the two of them every happiness.

stage. Since winning a talent contest several years ago,{Newline}
his unique act had been the favorite of local audiences.{Newline}
However, an extended slump had rendered him unable to{Newline}
perform. We spoke with him at length, and though we are{Newline}
unsure if our off-the-cuff suggestion for a new hairstyle{Newline}
made the difference, Mameco seems in better spirits.

{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}Count Minimas, famed in Dorter for his yearly{Newline}
donations to the Red Wings, found himself unable to open{Newline}

we couldn't help but think of the philanthropic count as{Newline}
one of the few hopes for our corrupt society.

{LS}We took part in the annual Clockwork Faire as{Newline}
assistants to the Goliphans machinists' club. The Goliphans{Newline}

the fact that there were more entrants than ever in the{Newline}
contest's history, the Goliphans' innovative clockwork{Newline}
chocobo carriage brought them victory.

{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}Not long ago, the wandering minstrel Mameco gave his{Newline}
first performance in nigh on ten years. Although he had{Newline}

spectacular yet. Our thoughts were with Mameco as he{Newline}

{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}A party was held at Gysahl Greens, an eatery renowned{Newline}
for its fine chocobo cuisine. What precisely the party was{Newline}
for we could not say, for we were much too busy working{Newline}

began preparing food, washed a mountain of dirty dishes,{Newline}
and finally worked to clean up after the party had finished.{Newline}
It was dawn before we were done.

{LS}The Blackjack, a casino ship equipped with slot machines{Newline}

Gambling is strictly regulated by the city, but the owner{Newline}

claims that he was merely trying to bring a little{Newline}
enjoyment into the drab lives of the townspeople.
{MClose}
{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}A casino ship, the Blackjack, had arrived in port, and{Newline}
we paid it a visit. Just as we were told, the slot machine{Newline}
in the far left corner immediately gave a seven on each{Newline}
reel—a jackpot! We continued to obtain jackpots, but our{Newline}
earnings were quite low. When asked, the ship's owner, a{Newline}
man by the name of Setzer, told us he had reduced the{Newline}
machine's payout to let people feel like they were winning.

{LS}We had been asked by Old Blanche to deliver her son{Newline}
Dinar his favorite dish. Upon learning he was slain by{Newline}

With a pass rate of 1 in 600, the exam is said to be one{Newline}
of the most difficult in Ivalice, and Michael is only the{Newline}

{LS}The Yardrow Melee is an event held annually in the{Newline}
Walled City. This is the 80th year that this contest has{Newline}
been held, and as such it has grown to become a sizeable{Newline}
competition. Although we were defeated once in the{Newline}
qualifying rounds, we were somehow able to advance to the{Newline}
final tournament, where we defeated Gustaf, a Yardrow{Newline}
assassin, to claim the title.

{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}The annual Zaland Melee took place just outside of the{Newline}
city proper. Champions from all over Ivalice were invited{Newline}

pitted against one another, allowing us to advance to the{Newline}
finals with relative ease. In the end, we emerged as the{Newline}
new champions of the competition.

{0xE4} {0xEB}{Newline}
{LS}A magick melee was held in Gariland. Competitors fought{Newline}
