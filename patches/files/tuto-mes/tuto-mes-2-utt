{0xEC71}{Color 08}Master Darlavon{Newline}
{Color 00}Now then, let us begin the lesson.{Newline}
{Newline}
In this session, we shall discuss the detailed{Newline}
information available to you on the status{Newline}
screen.{Newline}
This information forms the foundation on{Newline}
which you must build an understanding of{Newline}
your units, so pay close attention.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}There is much to cover, so let us start from{Newline}
the top left and work from there.{Newline}
{Newline}
The unit's portrait appears in the upper left{Newline}
corner of the screen.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}The number to the top right of the portrait{Newline}
is the unit's level.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}As a unit's level increases, his or her HP,{Newline}
MP, and Speed increase, as do his or her{Newline}
Power and Magick attributes.{Newline}
A unit's level increases by 1 for every 100{Newline}
experience points (EXP) earned.{Newline}
{Newline}
EXP is displayed directly to the right of{Newline}
the unit's level.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Units earn EXP during battle.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
Dealing damage to an enemy using physical{Newline}
or magick attacks will earn a unit EXP.{Newline}
{Newline}
However, no EXP is earned if the attack{Newline}
fails.{Newline}
{Newline}
The bars and numbers beneath LV and EXP{Newline}
are the HP, MP, and CT gauges.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}HP represents a unit's general physical well-{Newline}
being. As a unit takes damage during battle,{Newline}
his or her HP will decrease.{Newline}
The left number is the unit's current HP, and{Newline}
the right number is the unit's maximum HP.{Newline}
{Newline}
You must pay close attention to your units'{Newline}
remaining HP during battle.{Newline}
{Newline}
If a unit takes enough damage to reduce{Newline}
his or her HP to zero, he or she is KO'd and{Newline}
can no longer participate in battle.{Newline}
MP represents a unit's capacity for casting{Newline}
spells. Casting magicks consumes MP.{Newline}
{Newline}
The more powerful the magick, the more MP{Newline}
it will cost to cast.{Newline}
{Newline}
Once a unit's MP reaches zero, he or she may{Newline}
no longer cast magicks, so use it wisely.{Newline}
{Newline}
The CT gauge represents a unit's charge time.{Newline}
With each tick of the game clock, the gauge{Newline}
fills by an amount equal to the unit's Speed.{Newline}
When the CT gauge reaches 100, the unit's{Newline}
turn begins and he or she is free to perform{Newline}
an action.{Newline}
In battle, you can get an idea of when a{Newline}
unit may take his or her next turn by{Newline}
looking at his or her CT gauge.{Newline}
During actual battles, however, a number{Newline}
displaying the turn order appears to the left{Newline}
of a unit's level.{Newline}
Now let us examine the panel to the right.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}This indicator shows the side to which the{Newline}
selected unit belongs.{Newline}
{Newline}
During battle, the indicator color will tell{Newline}
you whether the unit is friendly or hostile.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}The number to the right is the unit's roster{Newline}
number. You may have up to 24 units in your{Newline}
party at any given time.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}To the right of the roster number is the{Newline}
unit's name.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Beneath the name is the unit's current job.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
As they amass experience, units can take on{Newline}
a variety of new jobs.{Newline}
{Newline}
To the bottom left of the unit's job, you will{Newline}
find his or her zodiac sign.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Some signs are more compatible with others.{Newline}
For example, ♈ Aries is said to be{Newline}
compatible with ♌ Leo.{Newline}
This compatibility determines the{Newline}
effectiveness of attacks and magick.{Newline}
{Newline}
Attacking an opponent with a compatible sign{Newline}
will deal greater damage.{Newline}
{Newline}
Likewise, damage to opponents with opposing{Newline}
signs will be reduced.{Newline}
{Newline}
To the right of a unit's sign, you will find his{Newline}
or her Bravery and Faith.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}A unit's Bravery has various effects in{Newline}
battle.{Newline}
{Newline}
The higher the value, the more brave a unit{Newline}
is, affecting bare-handed attacks and the{Newline}
use of reaction abilities.{Newline}
A unit's Faith indicates the strength of his{Newline}
or her belief in the divine.{Newline}
{Newline}
The higher this value, the more profound the{Newline}
unit's faith and understanding of mysterious{Newline}
phenomena beyond normal human knowledge.{Newline}
As such, Faith affects both the potency and{Newline}
success rate of magicks.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}This brings us to the panel in the middle of{Newline}
the screen.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}A unit's Move attribute indicates the number{Newline}
of tiles the unit may traverse in one turn.{Newline}
{Newline}
However, some terrain is more difficult to{Newline}
traverse. Crossing one of these tiles requires{Newline}
the effort needed to cross two normal tiles.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}A unit's Jump attribute indicates how high{Newline}
and how far the unit may jump.{Newline}
{Newline}
Units may jump vertically to a height (h){Newline}
equal to their Jump, and horizontally a{Newline}
number of tiles equal to half their Jump.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Speed indicates a unit's quickness.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
Since the CT gauge fills in increments equal{Newline}
to a unit's Speed, the higher a unit's Speed,{Newline}
the sooner his or her turn will come.{Newline}
In other words, the higher a unit's Speed,{Newline}
the faster it is and the more often it will{Newline}
receive a chance to act.{Newline}
The values for Move, Jump, and Speed are{Newline}
determined by a variety of factors.{Newline}
{Newline}
A unit's equipment, abilities, and unique{Newline}
characteristics are all factored into the{Newline}
final value.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Weapon Power refers to a weapon's Attack{Newline}
Power and Parry rate.{Newline}
{Newline}
R and L show the effectiveness of weapons{Newline}
equipped in the right and left hands.{Newline}
{Newline}
The left number displays the weapon's{Newline}
Attack, while the right number displays{Newline}
its Parry.{Newline}
The higher a weapon's Attack, the greater{Newline}
the damage it will deal.{Newline}
{Newline}
The higher a weapon's Parry, the greater{Newline}
the chance it will block incoming{Newline}
physical attacks.{Newline}
If the Parry ability has been assigned, the{Newline}
the chance a weapon will block a physical{Newline}
attack is doubled.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}These sword and rod icons represent{Newline}
physical and magick values, respectively.{Newline}
{Newline}
For ATK, C-EV, S-EV, and A-EV, the{Newline}
values for physical attacks are on the top{Newline}
row, and magick attacks on the bottom.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}ATK is the unit's combined Attack rating.{Newline}
These numbers are the unit's base Power{Newline}
and Magick, plus any ability bonuses.{Newline}
The top row displays the power of physical{Newline}
attacks (such as weapon attacks), and the{Newline}
bottom row displays that of magick attacks.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}C-EV, S-EV, and A-EV all indicate the{Newline}
chance of evading attacks.{Newline}
{Newline}
C-EV is the unit's, or character's, inherent{Newline}
chance of evading an attack.{Newline}
{Newline}
S-EV is the chance a unit will evade, or{Newline}
block, an attack with the shield he or she{Newline}
has equipped.{Newline}
A-EV is the chance an accessory the unit{Newline}
has equipped will help him or her evade an{Newline}
attack.{Newline}
As before, the values in the top row are{Newline}
for physical attacks, while the values in{Newline}
the bottom row are for magick attacks.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Now let's turn to the panel at the bottom{Newline}
of the screen.{Newline}
{Newline}
The unit's current equipment appears on{Newline}
the left, with his or her assigned abilities{Newline}
and commands appearing on the right.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}From the top, the equipment listed here{Newline}
is that for the right hand, left hand, head,{Newline}
and body, with an accessory at the bottom.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}The abilities and commands are listed on{Newline}
the right, beginning with the default job{Newline}
command.{Newline}
Below that are the optionally assigned job{Newline}
command, reaction ability, support ability,{Newline}
and movement ability.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Now you know all about the information{Newline}
available on the status screen.{Newline}
{Newline}
It is very important that you review your{Newline}
party's capabilities and level of advancement{Newline}
before entering battle.{Newline}
Understanding the meaning of these{Newline}
attributes is the only way to have a firm grasp{Newline}
of each unit's strengths and weaknesses.{Newline}
With that, I shall bring this lesson to a close.
