{0xEC71}{Color 08}Master Darlavon{Newline}
{Color 00}In this session, we will be discussing abilities.{Newline}
{Newline}
When a unit takes on a job, he or she can{Newline}
learn the abilities available to that job.{Newline}
{Newline}
As a unit progresses in his or her job, more{Newline}
and more of that job's unique abilities will{Newline}
become available.{Newline}
Allow me to explain the various types of{Newline}
abilities and how they are used.{Newline}
{Newline}
First, let us open the ability status window.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
It may be accessed by selecting a job from{Newline}
the job status window and pressing ×.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}This is the ability status window.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
Here you will see a list of the abilities{Newline}
offered by a particular job, and whether or not{Newline}
they have already been learned by the unit.{Newline}
These abilities may be learned when enough{Newline}
job points have been obtained for this job.{Newline}
{Newline}
Use the left and right buttons to cycle{Newline}
through the various types of abilities.{Newline}
{Newline}
There are four types of abilities, divided by{Newline}
how they are used.{Newline}
{Newline}
First of all, we have action abilities.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Action abilities are executed in battle as{Newline}
actions. They include many different types{Newline}
of skills and magicks.{Newline}
The white magicks Cure and Raise are{Newline}
examples of this kind of ability.{Newline}
{Newline}
Next are reaction abilities.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Reaction abilities are triggered when the{Newline}
unit is attacked by an enemy.{Newline}
{Newline}
Take the chemist's Auto-Potion ability,{Newline}
for example.{Newline}
{Newline}
This ability enables the unit to automatically{Newline}
use a potion when he or she suffers damage{Newline}
from an enemy attack.{Newline}
Next are support abilities.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Support abilities strengthen a unit's basic{Newline}
combat skills.{Newline}
{Newline}
They may allow the unit to equip different{Newline}
types of items, or increase offensive or{Newline}
defensive attributes.{Newline}
For example, Armor Lore and Combat{Newline}
Casting are both support abilities.{Newline}
{Newline}
Finally, we have movement abilities.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Movement abilities enhance the unit's mobility{Newline}
in some fashion.{Newline}
{Newline}
They may increase the distance that the unit{Newline}
may move, or add a special effect to his or{Newline}
her movement.{Newline}
Examples of this type of ability are Move +1{Newline}
and Lifefont, which restores HP to the unit{Newline}
whenever it moves.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}A unit may learn these abilities by using the{Newline}
job points saved up for each job.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}The number in the lower JP column is the{Newline}
number of job points required to learn that{Newline}
ability.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}This is the number of job points available for{Newline}
learning this job's abilities.{Newline}
{Newline}
When an ability is learned, its job points are{Newline}
subtracted from this amount. To get more job{Newline}
points, you must take the unit into battle.{Newline}
Additionally, a job's level is determined by the{Newline}
number in the Total column. This is the total{Newline}
JP the unit has earned for that job.{Newline}
You will need to look at the rightmost{Newline}
column to see how many job points are{Newline}
actually available to spend.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Now then, let's try learning a new ability.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
First, choose Abilities from the party menu to{Newline}
access the abilities menu.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Now choose the Learn command.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Choose which job you wish to learn an{Newline}
ability from.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Next, use the left and right buttons to cycle{Newline}
through the four types of abilities.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Only the abilities in black may be learned by{Newline}
the unit.{Newline}
{Newline}
The grayed-out abilities cannot be learned{Newline}
because the unit does not have enough job{Newline}
points.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}This unit just learned the Antidote ability.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
The abilities you have learned will have{Newline}
"Learned" displayed next to them in the{Newline}
JP cost column.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Next, let's examine how abilities are used in{Newline}
battle.{Newline}
{Newline}
Action abilities may be selected as actions on{Newline}
the battlefield.{Newline}
{Newline}
To do this, first select "Act" from the battle{Newline}
menu. Action abilities are listed as sub-{Newline}
commands after selecting "Act."{Newline}
Next, select one of the action abilities within{Newline}
that category.{Newline}
{Newline}
For example, the action abilities for the white{Newline}
mage job appear under the White Magicks{Newline}
job command.{Newline}
If a unit is a white mage, White Magicks will{Newline}
always be available.{Newline}
{Newline}
In other words, action abilities that the unit{Newline}
has learned for his or her current job will{Newline}
always be available to the unit.{Newline}
Look at the panel in the bottom left corner{Newline}
of the screen. The first icon represents the{Newline}
job command for the unit's current job.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}This command is fixed and cannot be changed.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
However, notice that there is another space{Newline}
with the same icon just below that.{Newline}
{Newline}
Here, you may place the job command of any job{Newline}
currently available to the unit.{Newline}
{Newline}
Once you have done this, that job's abilities{Newline}
will also be usable in battle.{Newline}
{Newline}
To select a job command to place here, use{Newline}
the Assign command on the abilities menu.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}When you select Assign, the cursor will move{Newline}
to the panel on the left-hand side of the{Newline}
screen.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Press × to select a different job command.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Select from among the choices on this list.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
Do remember that although this is a list of{Newline}
all jobs available to the unit, the unit may not{Newline}
have learned some of those jobs' abilities.{Newline}
Take care when making your selection.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}The three icons under the job commands{Newline}
represent other types of abilities.{Newline}
{Newline}
Third from the top is the unit's reaction{Newline}
ability, followed by support ability, and then{Newline}
movement ability.{Newline}
You may assign one of the abilities the unit{Newline}
has learned to each of these slots using the{Newline}
Assign command.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Unlike the first job command, these abilities{Newline}
are not automatically assigned when changing{Newline}
a unit's job.{Newline}
You may choose any ability the unit has {Newline}
learned for these slots, regardless of his or{Newline}
her current job.{Newline}
However, some jobs have special innate{Newline}
abilities that need not be assigned.{Newline}
{Newline}
For example, a ninja may use two weapons{Newline}
without being assigned the Dual Wield{Newline}
ability.{Newline}
There is no reason to assign abilities that{Newline}
overlap with a unit's innate ability, so they{Newline}
cannot be assigned by the player.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Thus, units are not limited to their current{Newline}
job's abilities. By using the Assign command,{Newline}
they may use previously learned abilities, too.{Newline}
This allows you to create units with a wide{Newline}
variety of abilities that should prove useful on{Newline}
the battlefield.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}This ends my explanation of abilities.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
Do your best to learn many abilities and to{Newline}
select the ones that will be most useful to{Newline}
you in a particular situation.{Newline}
With that, I shall bring this lesson to a close.
