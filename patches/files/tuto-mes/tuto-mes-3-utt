{0xEC71}{Color 08}Master Darlavon{Newline}
{Color 00}Now then, let us begin the lesson.{Newline}
{Newline}
In this session, we shall discuss the{Newline}
Equipment command available on the{Newline}
party menu.{Newline}
The party's items include an inventory{Newline}
available to all party members, as well as{Newline}
items equipped by specific units.{Newline}
When equipping a unit, you may choose from{Newline}
any of the items in the party's inventory.{Newline}
{Newline}
Let us examine the steps involved in{Newline}
equipping a unit.{Newline}
{Newline}
To open the party menu, press △ while{Newline}
viewing either the party roster or any of{Newline}
the status screens.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Select the first option, Equipment.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}The screen changes, with the equipment{Newline}
menu on the bottom right, and the unit's{Newline}
current equipment on the bottom left.{Newline}
As with the status screen, you may cycle{Newline}
through units using the L and R buttons.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Now let us examine the commands one by one.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Equip allows you to select an item from the{Newline}
party's inventory and outfit the currently{Newline}
selected unit with it.{Newline}
Let's give it a try. We start by selecting{Newline}
Equip.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Next, move the cursor to the spot you{Newline}
wish to equip.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}For now, we will change the equipment{Newline}
in the right hand.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}A list of items that may be equipped in the{Newline}
right hand appears.{Newline}
{Newline}
Items that are grayed out cannot be{Newline}
equipped by the unit's current job.{Newline}
{Newline}
You may find this easier if the list filters{Newline}
out items that the current unit cannot{Newline}
equip.{Newline}
In that case, simply set option 11, "Display{Newline}
Unequippable Items," to "Off" in the{Newline}
Options menu.{Newline}
The equipment list displays all items,{Newline}
including those in the party's inventory{Newline}
and items that are currently equipped.{Newline}
Even if an item is not grayed out, it may{Newline}
not be equippable if other units in the party{Newline}
have already equipped all of that item.{Newline}
The number of each item currently equipped{Newline}
(Eqp.) and the total number in the party's{Newline}
inventory (Total) appear beside each item.{Newline}
Let's attempt to equip a longsword.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Moving the cursor to an equippable item{Newline}
displays the change in attributes that{Newline}
would result from equipping that item.{Newline}
Equipping the longsword will raise weapon{Newline}
Attack by 1 and Parry by 4.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Equipping the dagger, however, would{Newline}
lower weapon Attack by 1.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Remember that the attributes displayed{Newline}
while selecting equipment are not the{Newline}
weapon's actual Attack and Parry.{Newline}
Rather, these numbers show the relative{Newline}
strength of the selected weapon against{Newline}
the unit's current equipment.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}There. We have successfully changed the{Newline}
unit's equipment.{Newline}
{Newline}
Press ○ to leave the list of the unit's{Newline}
current equipment and return to the{Newline}
equipment menu.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Using the Equip command requires that{Newline}
you carefully watch for changes in every{Newline}
attribute, which may be time-consuming.{Newline}
To save time, you may select Optimize to{Newline}
automatically equip your unit with the{Newline}
strongest available items in the inventory.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}A list of the strongest items that may be{Newline}
equipped by that unit appears, and you will{Newline}
be asked to confirm the changes.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}A panel showing any changes in the unit's{Newline}
attributes also appears, so you may refer to{Newline}
this while making your decision.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Although the automatically selected equipment{Newline}
is, for most purposes, the strongest available,{Newline}
you may wish to change certain assignments.{Newline}
In this case, it is preferable to go back and{Newline}
adjust only the individual pieces of equipment{Newline}
you wish to change.{Newline}
Now, if I may draw your attention to what{Newline}
we have just equipped in this unit's hands...
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Because the longbow is a two-handed weapon,{Newline}
it is equipped in both hands.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Let me take this opportunity to go into a little{Newline}
more detail on choosing equipment for a unit's{Newline}
hands.{Newline}
Generally speaking, units will carry a weapon{Newline}
in one hand and, provided they may equip it,{Newline}
a shield in the other.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Two-handed weapons such as bows or axes{Newline}
will be automatically equipped in both hands.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}But, if your unit has Doublehand assigned{Newline}
as a support ability, certain one-handed{Newline}
weapons can be wielded with two hands.{Newline}
Wielding a one-handed weapon with two{Newline}
hands deals significantly more damage.{Newline}
{Newline}
The Dual Wield support ability provides{Newline}
another exception to these rules.{Newline}
{Newline}
Dual Wield enables a unit to equip a{Newline}
weapon in each hand.{Newline}
{Newline}
With the exception of the ninja, units must{Newline}
have Dual Wield assigned to them in order{Newline}
to equip two weapons at the same time.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}The Remove command allows you{Newline}
to unequip an item from a unit.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Simply select the equipment you wish{Newline}
to remove.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Pressing the left button before confirming{Newline}
your selection will select all of the unit's{Newline}
equipment.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}The View List command brings up a list of the{Newline}
equipment in the party's inventory and that{Newline}
presently equipped by party members.{Newline}
From this list you can reorder, discard,{Newline}
unequip all, sort, and search to find what{Newline}
units are using certain equipment.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}This is the equipment list. Detailed information{Newline}
about the currently selected equipment appears{Newline}
at the top and bottom right of the screen.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}You may cycle through the different equipment{Newline}
categories by pressing the left and right{Newline}
buttons.{Newline}
The leftmost category contains equipment{Newline}
held in the hands.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Next to that is headwear.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}The center category is for clothing{Newline}
and body armor.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Next come accessories.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}And finally, consumable items.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Weapons and shields are held in the hands.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Weapons primarily affect weapon Attack{Newline}
and Parry rate, while shields determine{Newline}
Shield Evasion (S-EV).
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Helms and hats are types of{Newline}
equipment worn upon the head.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Equipment worn upon the head primarily{Newline}
provides boosts to HP and/or MP.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Clothing, armor, and robes are equipped{Newline}
on the body.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Equipment worn upon the body generally has{Newline}
effects such as increasing HP and/or MP{Newline}
as well.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Accessories include capes, rings, armguards,{Newline}
gauntlets, boots, and the like.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Accessories grant many different effects. Some{Newline}
boost certain attributes, while others protect{Newline}
against status effects.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Consumable items may only be used during{Newline}
battle and disappear once they are used.{Newline}
{Newline}
A unit must learn chemist abilities before{Newline}
he or she may use items.{Newline}
{Newline}
Items restore HP and remove status effects.{Newline}
For example, a phoenix down will revive a{Newline}
KO'd unit.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Next, let me explain the commands available{Newline}
while viewing the equipment list.{Newline}
{Newline}
You may reorder equipment in the list to be{Newline}
displayed in any way you like.{Newline}
{Newline}
First, move the cursor to the equipment{Newline}
you wish to move, then press ×.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Next, move the cursor up or down to the{Newline}
location to which you wish to move the{Newline}
equipment, then press × again.{Newline}
The two pieces of equipment will{Newline}
exchange places on the list.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Now, I shall explain how to search for{Newline}
units who are using a certain piece of{Newline}
equipment.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}First, move the cursor to a piece of{Newline}
equipment that is currently equipped, {Newline}
and then press △.{Newline}
This will display any units using the{Newline}
selected piece of equipment.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}If more than one unit is using the same{Newline}
equipment, you may use the L and R buttons{Newline}
to cycle through those units.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Next, let's examine the Discard, Unequip{Newline}
All, and Sort commands.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Pressing × twice while a piece of{Newline}
equipment is selected will open the{Newline}
equipment list menu.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Select Discard to throw away any number{Newline}
of the currently selected piece of{Newline}
equipment.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Unequip All will remove the selected piece of{Newline}
equipment from anyone in the party who has{Newline}
it equipped.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Sort allows you to set the order in which{Newline}
equipment is displayed by selecting from a{Newline}
list of criteria.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}There is little else to say about{Newline}
the equipment list.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}And so our discussion of equipment has{Newline}
reached its end.{Newline}
{Newline}
Equipment is a very important matter, so{Newline}
kindly take what I have said to heart.{Newline}
{Newline}
With that, I shall bring this lesson to a close.
