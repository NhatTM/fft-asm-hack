{0xEC71}{Color 08}Master Darlavon{Newline}
{Color 00}In this session, we shall discuss monsters.{Newline}
{Newline}
Monsters can join your party and fight{Newline}
for you in battle.{Newline}
{Newline}
Although monsters are treated much the{Newline}
same as human units, there are significant{Newline}
differences between the two.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Firstly, monsters are unable to equip items.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}This means they are unable to use items to{Newline}
increase HP or other attributes. They also{Newline}
cannot be assigned abilities.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Thus, monsters have no way of acquiring new{Newline}
skills.{Newline}
{Newline}
However, all monsters have from 1 to 3 special{Newline}
skills, which differ for each type of monster.{Newline}
{Newline}
If a human with the Beast Tamer ability fights{Newline}
on the same team, the monster will be{Newline}
granted one additional command.{Newline}
Aside from these, monsters cannot use any{Newline}
other commands. Furthermore, they have no{Newline}
jobs.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Since they do not have jobs, they quite rightly{Newline}
cannot use the Job command to change jobs.{Newline}
{Newline}
Thus, it is not possible to shape one's{Newline}
monsters into multi-talented warriors in the{Newline}
same way one can with human units.{Newline}
However, they do have some useful skills{Newline}
right from the start.{Newline}
{Newline}
For example, some may have the{Newline}
Counter reaction ability.{Newline}
{Newline}
And while some monsters cannot enter{Newline}
water, others may be able to fly.{Newline}
{Newline}
Finally, human units may ride chocobos.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
Riding a chocobo allows a human unit to take{Newline}
advantage of its increased mobility.{Newline}
{Newline}
As you can see, monsters are quite different{Newline}
from human units.{Newline}
{Newline}
If you take the time to train them and take{Newline}
advantage of their unique skills, monsters{Newline}
should prove invaluable companions.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Next, allow me to outline a few points that{Newline}
one must keep in mind when dealing with{Newline}
monster allies.{Newline}
Monsters in your party will occasionally{Newline}
lay eggs.{Newline}
{Newline}
After a certain number of days have passed,{Newline}
the eggs will hatch, revealing new monsters of{Newline}
the same type. These will also join your party.{Newline}
This is an auspicious event, but if allowed to{Newline}
continue unchecked, your party's ranks will soon{Newline}
be filled with nothing but monsters.{Newline}
In this case, you must not think twice about{Newline}
using the Dismiss command.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}Oh yesâ€”I almost forgot. You will not know{Newline}
precisely what kind of monster will appear from{Newline}
an egg until it hatches.{Newline}
For example, a normal chocobo may sometimes{Newline}
lay an egg that hatches to be a black chocobo.{Newline}
{Newline}
Each species of monster has any number of{Newline}
different varieties. Your new arrival may be{Newline}
of a kind you have never seen before.{Newline}
Try to raise a variety of different types of{Newline}
monsters.
{MClose}
{0xEC71}This concludes our discussion of monster allies.{Newline}
{Newline}
{Newline}
Although monsters are quite different from{Newline}
human units, I am sure that they will be useful{Newline}
additions to your party.{Newline}
With that, I shall bring this lesson to a close.
